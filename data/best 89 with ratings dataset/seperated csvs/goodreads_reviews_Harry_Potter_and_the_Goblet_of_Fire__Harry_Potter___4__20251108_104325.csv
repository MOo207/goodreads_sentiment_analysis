"(A) 86% | Extraordinary Notes: A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma. *Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates: - Preamble (1) I've said it before in comment replies, but I've always considered books 4-7 to be four parts of one very long book, which I call the ""Voldemort is Back Saga."" (2) Attending the Wizarding World Cup was mentioned at the end of ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" I think the only other tease of events to come was book six when HRH decided to leave Hogwarts. - 2% (1) The opening chapter is the first one not in Harry's POV. Another aspect that separates the latter books from the first three. (2) The village of Little Hangleton reminds me a lot of Pagford from ""The Casual Vacancy."" Both feature an abandoned manor house, for example. I wouldn't be surprised if the germ of that book started with this chapter. - 8% (1) Harry to Sirius: ""[Dudley] got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on."" - Historical inaccuracy. This takes place in 1994, the Playstation didn't come out until late 1995. (2) Last book, Hermione's letter mentioned Ron five times. Ron's letter here mentions her once :( - 10% (1) I think it's intentional, that right after Molly sort of intimidates Arthur into submission, Hermione does the same thing to Ron. It's juxtaposition! (2) I hear the name ""Ludo Bagman,"" and all I think of is ""Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong."" In my head he's Australian. (3) Wonder why Albania's such a hot wizard vacation destination? - 11% (1) Apparently, wizards don't use the metric system. Arthur needs Harry to help him pay the campsite manager in muggle money. (2) ""The Lovegoods"" are mentioned here. Probably Luna and her father – her mother having passed. (3) The only thing we know about Cedric, thus far, is he's handsome and athletic. Same as last book. Worth reminding, I guess. - 14% (1) In the book, Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys all cheer for Ireland. In the film, Harry and Ron support Bulgaria... I suppose so it doesn't look like they're all in Slytherin. (2) Crouch has a ""toothbrush mustache,"" also known as the Hitler mustache... or alternatively, the Charlie Chaplin mustache. (3) Crouch to Percy: ""Thank you, Weatherby."" - 16% (1) The Bulgarian mascots are veela... who can entrance men at will. Women aren't affected, which is an argument for having some female players... at least when playing Bulgaria. (2) ""'Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!' Bagman shouted."" - ""Runners-up"" would have been more prudent, if only for political sensitivities. - 18% (1) Just like ""Weird!"" is Ron's catchphrase, ""Honestly!"" is Hermione's. She says it, for example, whenever Harry or Ron are entranced by veela. You'd think ""the brightest witch of her age"" would understand it's involuntary. (2) In the books, Hermione's always scared, while Ron's brave in the face of danger. In the films, it's the other way around. - 20% (1) Boy, after the World Cup, wizards be clamoring for portkeys like it's toilet paper at a Costco. Mass hysteria! (2) Harry says his scar hurt. Ron suggests they play quidditch to de-stress while Hermione insists he needs a nap. Ron and Hermione sort of have a fun parent/strict parent dynamic in this situation. Very much like Arthur and Molly do. - 22% (1) Harry's dress robe is brand new and bottle-green, while Ron's is shabby, lacy and second-hand. It's totally Ron's Cinderella moment! (2) Bill: ""[Rita Skeeter] called me ‘a long-haired pillock’."" Molly: ""Well, it is a bit long, dear ... If you’d just let me —"" Bill: ""No, Mum."" - In the film all the Weasley boys and Harry have really long hair! - 24% (1) '""Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise. ""Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.” ""Just you, then,” said Ron. ""So go on.""' - Hermione citing ""Hogwarts, A History,"" expecting everyone's read it, and Ron saying she's the only one who ever has never gets old. It's my favorite recurring bit. - 26% (1) I just put together that ""Beauxbaton"" means ""beautiful wand"" in French. Mind blown! I don’t speak German so I can’t say if ""Durmstrang"" means anything. Though, knowing Rowling's penchant for stereotypes it's probably something downright Wagnerian: turmoil, fury and the like. (2) Apparently, Durmstrang offers courses in breakdancing. (see gif) - 27% (1) ""Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth."" - Ironically, or fittingly, this is use to cure acne. (2) ""Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying."" - To be fair, he very often does nearly die. - 29% (1) Lavender: ""Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?"" Trelawney: ""It is Uranus, my dear."" Ron: ""Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?"" - Ron will regret planting that seed. (2) Hagrid: “Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.” - Sadly, Hagrid can't legally do magic. - 30% (1) Moody forcing Neville to witness the imperius curse is really cruel, knowing the backstory. (2) '""It’s all right, sonny,” [Moody] said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office?... we can have a cup of tea..."" Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody.' - Wonder how Moody prepares tea, and what china he uses. - 32% (1) ""Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire."" - As an alliteration aficionado, I approve. (2) '[Harry] just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. ""What’s in the box?"" he asked [Hermione], pointing at it.' - What's in the box? What's in the box!! (it's ""Se7en"" reference) - 33% (1) Hermione turns on ""Hogwarts, A History"" for not mentioning house elf abuse. Priceless! (2) '""You only like [Cedric] because he’s handsome,"" said Ron scathingly. “Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly. Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like ""Lockhart!""' - Ron with the sick burn! - 34% (1) The Beauxbatons sit with the Ravenclaws and the Durmstrangs sit with the Slytherins. Thus foreshadowing that Hogwarts' champion will come from Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, or both. (2) Ron: ""What’s that?"" Hermione: ""Bouillabaisse"" Ron: ""Bless you."" Hermione: ""It’s French ... It’s very nice."" - Hermione, quickly after, stops liking French things. - 36% (1) Hagrid dresses for courting just the same as he does for court! (2) The Goblet of Fire is made of wood! Must be non-flammable wood. (3) ""[Crouch's] toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd."" - Yes, uncomfortably odd. The mustache had me wondering, but the ""severe parting"" confirmed it. Crouch is intended to remind you of Hitler. - 38% (1) '""Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once ... ""Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"" Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?' - Well, Harry is somewhat shorter than average. (2) ""Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” [Dumbledore] asked calmly."" - Yes, ""calmly."" See gif. - 40% (1) The Gryffindors throw a party to celebrate Harry (supposedly) cheating to get into the tournament. Celebrating deceit seems more like a Slytherin thing to me. (2) Stephen Fry uses the same voice for both Hermione and Professor McGonagall. I don't know if it shows a lack of range for female voices, or if he's actually making some subtle point. - 42% (1) Malfoy turns Hermione's front teeth the size of tusks. Ron, instead of immediately trying to fist-fight Malfoy, runs to comfort Hermione. That's character development! (2) Rita Skeeter forces Harry to squeeze into a dark broom closet with her for an interview. In my head I'm screaming, ""He's underage! That's the whole reason for the scandal!"" - 44% (1) Last book it was Hermione who was on the outs with Harry and Ron, here it's the opposite. I appreciate the mirroring! (2) Rita Skeeter writes that Hermione's Harry's girlfriend... thus begins the boy-girl drama! (3) Hermione: ""[Krum]'s not even good-looking! ... [girls] only like him because he’s famous!"" - She'll change her tune soon enough. - 46% (1) Hagrid shows Maxime, and by proxy Beauxbâtons, the secret first task simply to get her to like him. On one hand, it's helping the competition. On the other hand, everyone cheats anyway, and at least he gets the girl. (2) '""Never mind me, how are you?"" said Sirius seriously.' - It finally happened! Been waiting the last two books for that pun. - 48% (1) '""Hermione,"" Harry said, through gritted teeth, ""will you shut up for a bit, please?""' - Without Ron, I guess the job of reining in Hermione falls to Harry. (2) Moody: ""Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been."" - I knew it! Though knowing the twist at the end, I question how true this statement actually is. - 50% (1) '""Got a plan?"" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know.""' - Bagman low-key offering to help Harry cheat sounds a lot like the start of a drug deal. (2) Rita Skeeter: ""I wonder if you could give me a quick word?"" Harry: ""Yeah, you can have a word ... Goodbye."" - 52% (1) Viktor Krum persistently stalking Hermione in the library is at the same time endearing and creepy. (2) Shame the whole ""Blast-Ended Skrewts"" subplot was cut from the film. I would have liked to see what ""the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen"" looked like. (3) Apparently, one elf's servile emancipation is another elf's grievous shame. - 55% (1) ""Why do they have to move in packs?"" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them .... ""How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?""' - I've totally been there. (2) 'Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light. ""Hermione ... you are a girl!"" ""Oh well spotted,"" she said acidly.' - 56% (1) ""Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it."" - In other words, ""Who's my new nemesis?"" (2) Parvati: ""Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall."" Ron: ""Right ... Where’s Hermione?"" - Wrong girl, Ron! Focus! - 57% (1) Dumbledore apparently found the Room of Requirement, filled with chamber pots, when he needed to urinate. (2) 'Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her ""Hermy-own."" ""Her-my-oh-nee,"" she said slowly and clearly. ""Herm-own-ninny."" ""Close enough,"" she said.' - Before I knew better, I pronounced it ""Hermy-won."" - 58% (1) ""The Weird Sisters ... were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn."" - Nice bit of historical accuracy there. 1994 was the very height of ""artfully ripped and torn"" clothes. (2) Ron insists Krum only asked Hermione to the Ball to get info on Harry. Jealousy aside, that's actually a legit concern. - 59% (1) Hermione: ""Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!"" Ron: ""Well — that just proves — completely missed the point —"" Narrator: ""[Harry] somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had."" - The saddest non-death scene of the series. - Hermione's tough, but so weak for Ron :( - 61% (1) Ron lays down some serious knowledge on giants. Filmmakers take note, Ron’s not dumb. (2) ""Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal."" - Yes, classic ""drunk at the office X-mas party and overcompensating the next day"" behavior. - 63% (1) Don't know if it's been accentuated, but Harry looks downright tiny in the gif. (2) Harry: ""What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?"" Myrtle: ""Sometimes, but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before."" Harry: ""I’m honored. You keep your eyes shut!"" - Moaning Myrtle... more like Pervy Myrtle, amiright? - 65% (1) Apparently, Myrtle being stuck in Hogwarts is sort of a jail sentence. The Ministry confined her there permanently for stalking Olive Hornby. So, technically she's a convict under a kind of house arrest. (2) Ironic how it's ""Moody"" who gives Harry the idea to pursue a career as an auror. I guess good ideas are good ideas no matter the source. *character limit",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
"Don't mind me, just crying my eyes out. This was WAY better than I remember it being, and I remember it being pretty darn good. J.K. Rowling is a writing goddess and I can't believe how much foresight and planning went into this series.

"I know what you’re thinking: don’t I have anything better to do than reread a 750-page-long book on my weekend? Of course I do! I could try my hand at baking bread, cakes, muffins, or any other carb-heavy project, and then share the results on my social media—risking transforming into Thor’s big-bellied image from the last Avengers movie after consuming them incessantly, like most of my friends have done since quarantine began (it will end eventually, right?). But wait a minute—scratch that idea! If I insisted on baking, I’d only end up posing with burned or overcooked disasters. I could also resume my at-home soccer matches with my dearest husband, but there’s not a single intact glass left in our house. Walking barefoot still stresses me out because, for all I know, there’s a tiny, threatening shard of glass hiding somewhere, just waiting for me to step on it. And of course, after devouring Ozark, La Casa de Papel, Tiger King, and Unorthodox, I’ve struggled to find anything else that matches my taste in shows. Sure, I’m already juggling three books, but on weekends, melancholy creeps in. That’s when I gravitate toward things that made me happy in the past—like rewatching Shaun of the Dead, The Big Lebowski, and Fight Club. The best part? Every rewatch reveals new details you missed before! Speaking of books, the third one in my current series is my favorite. It’s special because it’s the last time my “three musketeers” retained their innocence before stepping into the dark side. This book I’m revisiting now marks the beginning of that darkness. It’s the middle part of a long series—a pivotal installment. A major death shakes the characters to their core, and their lives are forever changed. This is one of the darkest, most action-packed, gripping, and heartbreaking books in the series. When I first read it nearly 20 years ago, I wasn’t intimidated by its length. On the contrary, I felt lucky—finally, a Harry Potter novel that I couldn’t finish in a day! (For context: I devoured the first three books in a day each. Correction: the first book only took me half a day, thanks to the speed-reading skills I developed during college.) The book’s length felt like a gift because it meant I could spend more time immersed in Harry Potter’s world. As I revisited the Quidditch World Cup chapters, I was in awe of J.K. Rowling’s creativity and visionary writing. It transported me back to my younger, more naïve self, reminding me of how much I’d cherished each chapter, thrilled at Harry’s victories, and been utterly shocked by the ending. I loved it all over again and promised myself to reread it in another 20 years (hopefully not during a quarantine next time!). I recommend revisiting books that let you time-travel to happier moments in your past. They help you face the terrors of today and find the strength to carry hope into tomorrow. That’s why J.K. Rowling remains one of my all-time favorite authors!",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
"There is an incredibly somber mood that descends on me every time I finish this book in the series, and reading it with the illustrations did nothing to change that. I felt the drawings were impeccable, and I loved how some of the characters were reimagined to look a different way than portrayed in the movies, my favorite being Mad Eye Moody. Now, the long wait for the remainder of the illustrated editions. :(",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6

"""I is a good elf"" It's been proven three times now, that I always get ahead of myself when reviewing Harry Potter, incorrectly concluding the last one (out of the ones I've read so far) to be the best, but it cannot be helped. The standards are moved up - again. It's like Rowling just had a look at the first books, found them to be way too short, and came up with this one, which is much longer than the previous ones - combined! And the writing style keeps on improving, while plot getting more and more thrilling, making it oh so delightful to read. ""Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?"" It's great to have that feeling of 'how easy it is to read everything is' still being part of the author's narration. Though the events are being described in much more detail, it does not take away anything in terms of interest. On the contrary, the reader is kept well in suspense, with a number of twists, without making anything too unreal (relative to the world of magic that is). I don't recall ever being more immersed in a book than this one (again, I'm probably getting ahead of myself). ""Alf-giant? Moi? I'ave - I'ave big bone!"" As far as the environs go, I think it's safe to say that we've arrived at darker times, toward which the third book made way for. Though I loved the first three 'relatively-trouble-free' years, this one is certainly more interesting with so much happening, while introducing a whole new set of interesting characters. And the occasional humor complements nicely without distracting the reader too much. I don't think I'll be able to rest well until I'm done with the series. I kind of feel sad about the readers during original release years, who had to wait year after year for the next book. Must've felt being under 'Crucio'. ""If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.""",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
"“Differences of habit, language and gender are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.” - Not J.K. Rowling, I'm afraid. I love Harry Potter as much as anyone, which is why I urge everyone who spends money on these books to also support the trans community. To say it with the author's words: “If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” Well. Here’s a list of organisations that support trans lives (feel free to reach out and recommend more). Every penny counts: because Black trans lives matter.",,,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
"This was the beginning of my addiction to POT ter. I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POT ter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POT ter HEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet ...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called ""experts"" who say POT ter is brain cell killing pap. Don’t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn’t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POT ter makes you feel good. POT ter makes you smile. POT ter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POT ter makes you want to use the word giggly. POT ter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POT ter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POT ter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already ""been there done that"" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POT ter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POT ter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn’t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling’s breezy, “ear friendly” prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It’s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

It was cool to see the tournament come to life though! 🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie ***Warning: Binge Mode contains adult content*** It's very hard to turn a book into a movie. True fans of the book series will never be 100% satisfied and this is the case here as well. They pointed out that Sirius is all but missing from the movie, which is really too bad- cause the book really built that relationship and showed how much Sirius cares for Harry.

"“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.” So this quote kind of sums up what “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” was really about and I think it was cleverly done. ;-) As always there’s so much to talk about and I decided to continue with another of my “My thoughts about this book” reviews. For HP this seems to be the best solution because otherwise I’d end up writing 5.000 words essays and we all know that 1.) Goodreads won’t let me post them and 2.) No one would even want to read so much! *lol* So random thoughts it is! 1.) ”Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?” “It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves,” said Bill. I found it really odd that the term “Death Eaters” was mentioned and explained for the very first time in here. I mean Voldemort and his Death Eaters are one of the first things that come to mind when you think about HP. I thought it would have been mentioned in one of the earlier books already, but nope, it really was the first mention. Knowing the Death Eaters will accompany us for the rest of the series this was kind of shocking. XD 2.) ”I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs Weasley said, starting to sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough O.W.Ls? Oh, Fred... George...” Mrs. Weasley is legit one of the best moms ever and you can feel her love for all of her kids including Hermione and Harry. So yes, this a Molly Weasley appreciation moment and I still think that she is one of the most underrated characters in the entire series! I love that woman! <3 3.) ”Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily. Hermione clearly found her self-confidence and poise after “The Prisoner of Azkaban”. XD I loved how she always retorted comments that were thrown at her. She’s so smart it was a pleasure to see her stand up for herself! (and others) And yes, I admit it, just like Ron I wanted to hold the memory of Malfoy the bouncing little ferret in my mind. *lol* 4.) ”How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared.” Ahh Mad-Eye Moody! As much as I agreed with a lot of the things he said, I also disagreed with a lot of the things he did. Does that even make sense? XD For me Mad-Eye is one of those super morally grey characters because he sometimes does bad things for “the greater good”. Then again his character is consistent too because as an Auror he saw what dark wizards are capable of and he’s totally right when he says that they won’t play nice and fair. Guess I’ll always feel conflicted about him. 5.) ”Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione. “Oh, yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled, in the same unnaturally high voice. “Very interesting dinner – I mean lesson – what’s for eating?” Neville will always break my heart. That poor boy deserved so much better than he got and I’ve such a soft spot for him. He’s another of those Hogwarts characters I really would have loved to read more about and no matter what people think: He is brave and a true Gryffindor! <3 6.) Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.” And here we have another reason why Snape can’t be redeemed. He’s just nasty and mean to his students and a real bully. No matter what happened in his past, he should know better than to let his students suffer for it. I still think that movie Snape is way nicer than book Snape and if you only know book Snape you know why I don’t like him. I might understand his reasons, but I still hate him. >_< 7.) ”Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break. “D-Dobby?” Harry gasped. I love Dobby so much! <333 He’s such an adorable and sweet guy and it was so good to see him so happy! He’s probably the only house elf that appreciates his freedom but considering his former masters it’s no wonder he’s happy to do what he wants. *lol* Guess you’ve to experience the Malfoy’s as your masters to truly appreciate freedom. ;-P 8.) ”Oh, I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?” “Er – yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron. *sighs* I usually like Ron but I never liked his “Goblet of Fire” version and I still don’t. I mean yes, he’s a teenage boy who’s going through puberty but that doesn’t excuse the many horrible things he does and says in this one. To say it plainly he’s a total dumbass in GoF and I really don’t like him. At least in this book. First he doesn’t believe Harry and then he’s hurting Hermione whenever he opens his mouth, just because his teenage hormones apparently make it hard to think before he says something. We could blame it on puberty but I think there’s so much more going on... Luckily Hermione is clever enough to see through it. 9.) ”Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished.” And here’s another breadcrumb that will be relevant in the next book. XD You gotta love how Rowling scatters them in the earlier books and makes use of them later on. ;-) 10.) ”If you really want to know, he – he said he’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up the courage!” So after three books we dive right into the teenage drama and angst. Which is kind of suitable for their age but boy, did it impact their friendship in this one. I think from now on there’s no book in which they don’t have a conflict of some sort. No matter if it’s Ron/Harry or Hermione/Ron. There always seems to be something brewing between the trio. And bless Victor Krum for realizing how beautiful Hermione is! If none of the two boys at her side can see it, at least Victor can! I think he knows her value way more than her closest friends and I really appreciate him for it. =) 11.) ”Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly. Harry giving Rita Skeeter a piece of his mind is one of the best things in this book. That woman is horrible and she’ll only get even worse as the series proceeds. Harry’s got guts to confront her directly and I just love him for it. 12.) But Sirius shook his head and said. “She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” And here’s another character I’d love to see more of! Sirius Black is one of the best and I loved how protective he’s of Harry! He’s like a lion protecting his pup and I lived and breathed for it. After everything Harry went through he deserves someone who loves him and stands up for him. Even if it’s against Dumbledore because he wants Harry to rest and feel better instead of recounting events. Sirius placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder and defending him against Dumbledore’s questions really made my day! Best guardian ever! 13.) ”Yes,” said Harry. “Professor – I was in Divination just now, and – er – I fell asleep.” He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, “Quite understandable. Continue.” Haha! As much as I disliked Dumbledore forcing Harry to relive that horrible night I still can’t help but love him for his attitude. He’s one of the best teachers ever and the fact he didn’t even bat an eye when Harry told him that he fell asleep in Divination. Priceless! *lol* 14.) ”And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason – he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort’s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defence was possible...” I LOVE Harry so damn much, I can’t even! He’s one hell of a brave boy and I can’t even imagine how terrified he must have been. Yet he still refused to back down and didn’t give Voldemort the satisfaction of seeing him cower in front of him. This moment shows the true Gryffindor in him and why he got sorted into the house. When push comes to shove Harry always does the right and noble thing! <3 My precious boy! 15.) ”Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.” “He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered – it seemed important to explain this. “He wanted me to bring him back to his parents...” “That’s right, Harry... just let go, now...” This moment always makes me cry! Cedric Diggory’s death is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in this series and it will always break my heart. No matter how often I read it, it’s still devastating. And Harry’s reaction to it, knowing that he could have been alive if he would have touched that portkey without him... It’s the first time that he has to live with the death of someone he knew and liked and it’s even worse because he feels guilty. What if he would have done the egoistic thing and won the tournament? What if he wouldn’t have offered Cedric to win together? For the first time ever his sense of fairness and his honour brought death to someone and his feelings are so complex I could cry. He did the right thing but it ended badly and left him devastated. If that’s not the symbolical embodiment of growing up then I don’t know. 16.) Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry. “Come along, Potter,” she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. “Come along... hospital wing...” To see McGonagall show so much emotion about broke me. This woman is always so composed and knows exactly what she’s doing but for the first time ever she can’t seem to be able to ignore her own feelings. She cares about Harry deeply and it never showed as much as after Cedric��s death. Such a great and beautiful scene! 17.) ”Fail to act – and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!” Well, and that’s about exactly what happens. Fudge didn’t take Harry’s story seriously and the wizarding world had to pay the price for his ignorance. It’s kind of eerie how Rowling captured politics and how the fact that they work so slowly is standing in their own way. At first Fudge didn’t react and once he did, it was too slow to make a difference. He kind of dug his own grave with his actions at the end of GoF and history will indeed remember him as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort to take a second shot at power. “The Order of the Phoenix” is up next and it’s the last book I have to borrow from the library because I actually have book 6 and 7 in English at home. =) So let’s hope I’ll be able to borrow book 5 soon. ____________________________________ I always forget how serious those books become. “The Prisoner of Azkaban” was already very dark but I think “The Goblet of Fire” stepped it up a notch. The ending will always get me, no matter how old I am. >_< Full RTC soon! Stay tuned! P.S: I borrowed this twice from my library. *lol* That’s how I was able to continue. Thankfully they have a lot of copies of HP! XD ____________________________________ I just borrowed this from my library but of course someone else already preordered it again. >_< So I guess that means I’ll have to be fast and start now! 617 pages with a super tiny font. I CAN DO THIS!!! Or well, at least I hope I can. *lol* Regardless of everything I just said “The Goblet of Fire” has always been one of my favourite HP books. I’m curious if I’ll feel the same way after rereading it now. Which HP book is your favourite and why? =)",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6

"Complete 5 Golden Stars one of my favourites all the thrills, mysteries, the competition, more lovely characters. (some more jerks too that I wanted to hit their heads at the wall) THAT ENDING! Now I'm writing this, after many times re-read, I exactly remembered my first reaction after finishing this book, after that horror in the end of the book, I was awestruck; ""WHY THIS BOOK IS OVER!? give me more!"" & then there was no book 5, you see the pain? after the biggest plot twists of the series (which I was looking forward to it so much) I had to wait! Harry Potter series was my first in many things; my first novel, my first fantasy, my first book crush, & one of them was my first Cliffhanger! this book is the point that the world started to getting Darker & a little out of mere-middle-grade-ish part. not that previous books were childish, but they're fun & cute & the protagonists are younger; suitable for both kids & young readers, but now things getting more serious & dark. I love how Rowling's slowly revealing the wizarding world's secrets to us, each book has something new about the world. we have time to process the interesting new info & remember it later. (the complete opposite of info-dump) & I believe it's a talent. & here it's about the first war & You know who's followers & rituals. We're also about to see the Quidditch World Cup (Fudge was so funny here!) & getting more information about the magical educations around the world. the plot; we knew something were off, but we can't exactly pinpointed it until the end when the truth revealed. Rowling knows how to reveal a plot twist in the most shocking way. (she actually proved it a few times in book 1, 2 & 3! but still surprising how brilliant it is.) Harry's suddenly in trouble & he doesn't know how. I like Krum. & all the predicaments the Trio should struggle through made by Rita Skeeter, bullies & the mean students, but they didn't cower or hide, they held their head high & ignoring them. I always loved villains in disguises, they are interesting & cunning & we can't tell until they revealed their secrets. the feel of bewildered betrayal the hero going through. the writing style is fun as always, comparing to book one, it has improved a lot, now it's graceful & rich. the villain's chapter was the best villain-ish/not-Harry-related POV in the whole series; intriguing & spooky. the movie was good, but didn't do the justice toward the book, it felt so rushed & deleted many parts of the book. I would've liked to see the Quidditch World cup Final match on the screen, the real ""interesting"" 3rd task & the Sphinx, the hilarious scenes by Ludo, Dobby, Winky & her story or showing the stubborn stupid refusal of that gargoyle to accept the truth & the cleavage in the society in the end. & while fans are angry about ""Dumbledore asked calmly"" part that turned out the total opposite in the movie (& I totally LAUGHED at that part everytime I reach that moment in either the book or the movie), I'm MAD at how movie Harry acted out-of-character in one scene in the movie (just because increasing the thrills I suppose) when he did exactly the opposite in the book.",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
"Ahhhh...the last happy Harry Potter (I know, I know, not 100% happy but the last truly 'happy' one for a while.) When I first read this book, I was so engrossed in the Quidditch World Cup that I actually forgot there was going to be a plot for the rest of the story. It was so fun to follow the wizarding world in this sport-related tangent (and I am NOT a sport person, though maybe if we had flying brooms, I could get with the sports). Then there was the triwizard tournament where I was so invested in the outcome that I forgot to be focused on what sort of evil stalked Harry in this book - it was just such a fun twist on the series! And of course, the maze ending had me absolutely SHOCKED cause like I said, I was having so much fun bopping around to the story that WHOOPS there's actual serious consequences out there.

"“The truth is generally preferable to lies.” -Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire JK Rowling knows how to write highly readable text. She specializes in short, highly digestible paragraphs. The pages flow pretty quickly. She also elevates the problems of Harry Potter from just one boy to good versus evil. However, this book was too long. I wish that Rowling shortened the book, cutting out Rita Skeeter, Quidditch, and The Yule Ball.

"English ( ) / Italiano «The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the Riddle House”, even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there» Maybe this time I was out of line with the bedtime reading to my daughter, not so much for the size of the book, but for its darker content compared to the previous ones. Towards the end of this fourth book in the Harry Potter series, my little girl had difficulty falling asleep. I had to defuse the situation. The Quidditch World Cup is coming, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have the chance to watch the final round, before the start of the new school year.

"2024: It’s been four years and I’m rereading with my teenagers, challenged by the thirteen year old to join her in a reread. It’s part of our summer movie lineup so why not. Just yesterday she astutely stated that I would view Harry differently if I had his world available to me when I was a kid. I answered maybe. J.K. Rowling published the Sorcerer’s Stone in the U.S. in 1998, the year I finished my first year of college. Harry is according to Rowling, less than a year younger than me, born July 31, 1980. The battle of Hogwarts took place in 1997, the year I graduated high school. Perhaps, all seven of these books are Harry’s memories in a pensieve, told in flash back form. Would I have viewed the books differently as kid? Maybe. I was always a cerebral book worm. My parents have little use for pop culture. I didn’t watch A New Hope for the first time until I was at a weekend event in high school. Maybe as an eight year old I would have looked at Harry in awe. By age eleven I was reading adult books but lacked life knowledge to appreciate them. I would have loved to have Hermoine around for companionship. So that is the long answer to her question. She rolled her eyes, of course. As usual, book 4 is the one I read in anticipation of what will happen, knowing the course of events backward and forward. It is the crossroads book because of what we know that occurs in the last fifty pages. Instead of feeling angered in the book’s closing chapters, I cried. That’s right. After twenty or so times reading this book, I cried over Mrs Weasley’s motherly treatment toward Harry. The rest of the book, I laughed, cringed, and grew frustrated at the appropriate times, but I rarely show tears at anything- only tears of joy when the Cubs won the World Series. So to answer my daughter, yes, I most likely would have viewed these books differently as a kid. I would have related to the kids in the stories as the kids they are rather than over analyzing every last move. I would have detested Snape because Harry does and cheer for Sirius because Harry does that as well. Would I view the end of book 3 as my favorite still, remains to be seen. My daughter wise beyond her years is correct in assessing that I was denied a childhood pleasure not having Harry available to me as a kid. I am fortunate to have had him around for my entire adult life. Rather than viewing these as adventures, I have viewed the septology as a world that I can escape into every few years or so when I need a dose of magic in my life. If Harry can get the better of the Slytherins, the child in me is all for it. Now on to my most detested book 5 and hope it does not soil my summer. 2020: Here I am in March 2020. It is day eleven of isolation and no school or work for most of us. I have four kids all learning by phone conference call or online chat, all on slightly different schedules, and I am here utilizing my education degree in case anyone needs clarification on an assignment. I wish I did not have the opportunity to put my education degree to such hands on use. Under normal circumstances, I would be gearing up for another baseball season and preparing for Passover, the dual rites of spring, but 2020 is hardly normal. With a new temporary normal upon us, I decided to reread Harry Potter along with two of my kids, who are embarking on rereads of their own. As the series grows progressively darker, there is also the underlying presence of hope. In these dark times, we all need a daily dose of magic in our lives, and, like an old friend, Harry is there for us. If Harry Potter were real life, Harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at Hogwarts. With important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches, Harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education. Dark forces are gathering, as had been predicted throughout the first three books. With his servant returned to him, Lord Voldemort is determined to rise again, more powerful and lethal than ever before. Harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar, his connection to Voldemort, has bothered him over the summer. Reaching out to his father figures, it is apparent to all that Voldemort is gathering strength, and Harry represents the best chance to conquer him; that is, if he can get through a year at Hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education. With these forces both inside and outside of Hogwarts building up, determined to do Harry in, the fourth year at Hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet. With summer vacation nearly over, Harry returns to his friend’s Ron’s house named The Burrow to see the final of the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has, starting with the eldest Weasley brothers Bill and Charlie. Ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother, and now we see that Bill and Charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school. This theme of it measuring up to either Harry or his brothers stays with Ron for the rest of the series, and undoubtedly for the rest of his life. Here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks. We find another form of transportation, a portkey, an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly; of course, a portkey will reappear later in the book as Rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on. The scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world. The color and innocence of childhood is about to end, and then Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and their contemporaries return to another year at school. Professor Dumbledore introduces the Tri Wizard Tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies. One must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire, which is guarded by Dumbledore’s age line. Fred and George would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons, which they would love to start a joke shop; even they are no match for Dumbledore’s advanced magic. Somehow, someone who wants Harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire. Although only fourteen, Harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions. His friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses, those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other Hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of Voldemort. The tasks in the tournament, which include battling dragons, Mer people, and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should Voldemort return to power. Harry, exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome Voldemort on multiple occasions, represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating Voldemort again. Here as the arc of the series reaches its apex, it is obvious that Harry will be destined to fight Voldemort again. The education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle. Rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well: Fred and George’s determination to create jokes, Ron and Hermoine’s growing relationship which comes to a head at the Yule Ball, the foul reporter Rita Skeeter. Readers acquire more magical knowledge as well. Dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve. This object will continue to play a role throughout the series, but here we learn about the trials against Voldemort’s supporters during his first downfall. We find new information about Neville’s family as well as Professor Snape, and wonder whose side he is really on, something that isn’t resolved until the end. Hagrid notes that whatever comes, will come, and Rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever. House elves and giants play a prominent role, dementors bide their time to rejoin Voldemort, and Sirius returns to play his role as Harry’s godfather to the best of his ability. Sirius’ presence throughout this book tethers Harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure, taking his place as the family Harry never had, and reminding Harry the need to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Three long books remain. As I am at home with more time than I anticipated to read this series, I may finish sooner than later. It is always bittersweet as I reach this turning point in the series, as Hagrid tells Harry to brace for darker days ahead, just as we are doing in real life now. My kids and I are here for the long haul, both in our new reality of 2020 and on Harry’s journey to eradicate darkness. We will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers. Even though this may mirror what is going on in real life, at least for those hours that we are immersed in Harry’s world, we are experiencing a world other than our own, a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later. 5 stars",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
"“We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.” The summer is dragging and Harry can't wait to join the Weasleys and Hermione at The Burrow and go with them to the International Quidditch Cup final. It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry . This year will be different to the previous ones, for Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament , a competition which hasn't been hosted for a century. A contest involving two other international magical schools and three dangerous tasks, only students of age are allowed to compete in. Harry is looking forward to watching the games and supporting whoever the Hogwarts champion is. What Harry doesn't expect is finding himself entangled in these dangerous events. For me this is where the story really picks up. The games, as well as the dark atmosphere make this book so compelling. You can't help but want to know what happens next and how Harry decides to face all the challenges that come at him. “If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” The introduction of foreign wizards/witches in this book sets this one apart from the others. I absolutely loved seeing how different they are to the usual British magical community. And the rivalry that is usually present at Hogwarts between the Houses is amped-up. I really felt for Harry. He faces hate from the other students for something he had no control over as well as being shunned by one of his best friends. I don't know how he deals with everything honestly. “It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.” Our trio are growing up. I loved those scenes with Harry and Ron struggling to communicate with girls 😂. Their sudden awareness of the female population was so sweet. I always associate this book with magical Christmas-sy vibes. It just felt a lot more enchanting than the previous books in this series. “What’s comin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does.” ______ Buddy reading with ______ My reviews for: 1: 2: 3:",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
"4.5 stars I really don't think I need to tell y'all that I loved this because I've been raving about this series since the moment I started it back in January but for the sake of clarity - I love this. I believe everyone (even people that have no attachment to it at all) has a Harry Potter story under their belt. Whether it be the story of their first time reading it or the time they convinced everyone in their family to dress up as the Weasley's or when their Potterhead teacher made them play Quidditch in gym class, everyone has some kind of HP story they whip out at dinner parties - this is mine. Back in my early teens, after a childhood of ignoring the wizarding craze under the guise of my idiot-self being too sophisticated for magic (yes, 8-year-old Grace was an asshole - that isn't the story) I was a camp counsellor. But I wasn't a counsellor at any ordinary camp, oh no, I was a counsellor at a theatre camp. Each year we would put on a different musical and the year I was 15 it was decided we would do a child-friendly, dumbed down version of the Goblet of Fire, complete with all your favourite musical numbers stolen straight from A Very Potter Musical. I played James Potter, helped countless kids memorize their lines, choreography and ten musical numbers and yet the only plot points I picked up of the entire musical was the Yule Ball and Cedric Diggory's death. The whole time I was reading this book - 5 years later - all I could think about was that musical and what I knew was coming because of it. I was worried the entire novel and utterly heartbroken once it actually happened - 5 years of build up to finally understanding what was happening in this book and I'd say It was 100% satisfying. This book is masterful; it is the book where everything changes and you feel it with every flip of the page. It maintained the classic spirit of books 1-3 while perfectly balancing the added stakes and darkness. Also, like every other installment the way everything that is revealed at the end answers all your questions and puts all the more new ones straight back into your head was just as satisfying as it was the first three books and it was perfection. I want to curse 8-year-old Grace for being an idiot and 15-year-old Grace for not paying attention at work because, boy oh boy, do I wish I read this series sooner.",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",6
