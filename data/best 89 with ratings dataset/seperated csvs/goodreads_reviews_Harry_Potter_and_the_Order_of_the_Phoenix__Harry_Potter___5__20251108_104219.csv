"(A) 86% | Extraordinary Notes: An angsty apprehension, it's a tome of teacher torment, misbelief, new girlfriend grief, and dread no longer dormant. *Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates: - Preamble (1) You can tell things have gotten dark from the title sequence. No longer shiny metal against still skies. Now it's rusty, pitted metal against billowing clouds. (2) Prior to my current re-read of the series, this was my favorite. Before that it was ""Half-Blood Prince."" Wonder if it'll keep its position or if I'll have a new favorite this time. - 4% (1) Harry: ""Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too?"" - Oh, I can think of a few reasons... (2) Harry openly insulting his aunt and uncle and picking a fight with Dudley? This isn’t the Harry I know! (3) Super-angsty to start. ""No one understands me, no one tells me anything""... Someone’s been listening to Radiohead. - 6% (1) If you’re a wizard, don’t give your kids the initials AF, they’ll likely be a squib: Arabella Figg, Argus Filch. - Mrs. Figg's cat keeps tabs on Harry. Wonder if it's magic? (2) Petunia: ""I heard — that awful boy — telling her about [dementors] — years ago."" Harry: ""If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?"" - She means Snape. - 8% (1) ""Mundungus Fletcher"" is maybe Rowling's most expressive name, alluding to the words ""fungus,"" ""dung,"" and ""retch."" (2) Rowling loves adverbs. ""Stupidly"" is perhaps the most overused. (3) Lupin: ""And this is Nymphadora —"" Tonks: ""Don’t call me Nymphadora ... It’s Tonks."" - She does take his name when they're wed. Can't be that insistent on it. - 9% (1) Tonks: ""Are you mad, Mad-Eye?"" - Well, it's in the name. Though it could just be the eye that's mad. (2) House elf heads line the hallway of Sirius' place. Awfully macabre... though muggle taxidermy is common, so is placing urns on mantles. (3) Ron and Hermione spend the summer mostly alone in bedrooms together... wonder what they do all day? - 11% (1) Who knew Percy would be the Weasley black sheep? (2) Bill leaves Egypt for a desk job in London just to be close to Fleur. Some might call that romantic... others might call it stalking. (3) Molly: ""Who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?"" Also Molly: ""Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing?"" - I mean, put two and two together. - 12% (1) '""Arthur!"" said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. ""Arthur, back me up!""' - Is it really backing up a point if it's by coercion? and in front of everyone at that? (2) ""[Harry] had been touched by what [Mrs. Weasley] had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling."" - Wonder if ""mollycoddling"" is why she's named Molly? - 14% (1) '""Size is no guarantee of power,"" said George. ""Look at Ginny."" ""What d’you mean?"" said Harry. ""You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?""' - Married life will fix that. (2) ""Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George ... [looked] rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths."" - Life imitates art. - 19% (1) ""Mrs. Weasley ... started fussing with [Harry's] T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t."" - Get used to having a mom. (2) The Ministry has jurisdiction over Britain and Ireland. Huh, must not have split when Ireland left the union. (3) ""a heavy locket that none of them could open."" - Hmmm, curious... - 20% (1) ""Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore."" - In other words: Latin, Old-French, Anglo-Saxon, Irish, Old-English. (2) Molly: ""I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!"" George: ""What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?"" - Well, Harry was facing expulsion. Between Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Ron's the clear choice. - 22% (1) '""Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner ...Congratulations Ron and Hermione — New Prefects.""' - Cut out the ""New Prefects"" bit and you could reuse that banner. - It's always ""Ron and Hermione,"" like they're a music act or a comedy duo. (2) ""Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either."" - It nearly always boils down to daddy issues. - 23% (1) Considering the amount of time prefects spend together, it's no wonder so many end up as couples. (2) ""[Harry] would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people ... he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap."" - Ginny's also there, but Harry's as yet blind to her. - 24% (1) '""Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?"" he asked. ""Shut up, Malfoy,"" said Hermione sharply.' - More Ron/Hermione mirroring. Until now, it's always been Ron who's defended Hermione's honor against Malfoy's jibes. Here it's the other way around. (2) With Delores Umbridge, it'd be far more fitting for her initials to be FU instead of DU. - 25% One of these things is not like the other. (1) Students find it odd that Umbridge wears a pink cardigan. Not so much because it’s ugly, but mainly because it’s muggle attire. You know who else wears muggle clothes? Fudge. Umbridge is an insincere flatterer who does, or wears, anything to get to the top. A simple pink cardigan can say a lot about personality. - 27% (1) ""Harry was too used to [Ron and Hermione's] bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his ... steak-and-kidney pie."" - Smart. He's got his priorities straight. (2) Harry: ""[Umbridge's speech] sounded like a load of waffle to me."" Hermione: ""There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle."" - Mmm... waffles. - 28% (1) Hermione hates Lavender because she's anti-Harry. - She'll hate her even more when she's pro-Ron. (2) Ron and Hermione as prefects are like an old married couple. Hermione even bosses Ron around like Molly does with Arthur. (3) ""Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls."" - That gang sounds terrifying! - I always hated Cho. - 30% (1) ""Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,"" said Ron sagely. - It's a much sharper metaphor than leopards. - Ron's all about wizarding common sense. (2) Umbridge sings her responses to student queries. Though, Mary Poppins she's not. (3) '""Have a biscuit, Potter."" ""Have — what?"" ""Have a biscuit!"" [McGonagall] repeated impatiently.' - Take a biscuit, Harry! - 31% (1) Hermione: If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —"" Fred: ""Put us in detention?"" George: ""Make us write lines?"" Hermione: ""No ... but I will write to your mother."" - Ouch! She sure knows how to twist the knife. (2) Hermione knits woolly hats and hides them under rubbish, hoping to trick house elves into freedom as they clean. - I mean, that's just unethical. - 34% (1) Angelina's not an ideal Quidditch captain. When she's stressed she gets bossy, when she can't get her way she gets stressed, and so on. (2) Ron spots Harry's scarred hand and implores him to tell McGonagall or Dumbledore. - Yet another Ron scene given to Hermione in the film. (3) Knitting things no one wants is yet another trait Hermione has in common with Molly. - 35% (1) Ron makes the Quidditch team by process of elimination. Two people fared better at keeper tryouts, but Angelina found one whiny and the other unreliable. Thank goodness for that! (2) ""[Harry] walked on, feeling quietly elated ... [Cho] did not hate him for being alive!"" - Well, that's an awfully low bar. I'm fairly sure most people don't hate him for being alive. - 37% (1) O=Outstanding, E=Exceeds Expectations, A=Acceptable, P=Poor, D=Dreadful, T=Troll. - And people complain about my grading system... (2) Fred: ""Nothing wrong with a good, healthy P."" - I expect higher brow humor from the likes of Fred and George... puns are my thing. (3) Feel free to use my gifs. I post them on Imgur at: - 39% (1) '""But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —"" Hermione began. ""You sound like Molly,” said Sirius.' - Hermione/Molly comparisons continue. (2) Hermione: ""You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in... we’ve got to do something about [Umbridge]."" Ron: ""I suggested poison."" - Well, poison would certainly be effective. - Ron, always with the practical ideas. - 41% (1) Ron: ""You’re not still in contact with [Viktor], are you?"" Hermione: ""So what if I am? ... I can have a pen pal if I —"" Ron: ""He didn’t only want to be your pen pal."" - Ron knows what's up. (2) ""The barman ... [had] a great deal of long gray hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry."" - Hmm... who's tall and thin with a long beard? - 44% (1) Ginny starts dating Michael Corner, Ron hates Michael Corner... it's math. (2) Hermione: ""It says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls."" - On the whole, sure. Though a girl is the book's big turncoat. (3) Harry: ""Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself..."" - Moments after founding a clandestine outlaw combat guild. - 47% (1) In the book, The Room of Requirement is Dobby's idea, in the film it's Neville's. Same with gillyweed in ""Goblet of Fire."" - Ergo, film Neville is book Dobby. (2) Hermione: ""I think we ought to elect a leader."" Cho: ""Harry’s leader."" Hermione: ""Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly ... It makes it formal."" - I don't know... the vote seems rigged to me. - 51% (1) '""Good luck, Ron,"" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek ... He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened.' - Ron had the same reaction with Fleur, except Hermione doesn't have veela powers. (2) ""Weasley is Our King"" is a hit song. Everyone sings it. - 52% (1) ""Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains."" - My feeling exactly! But then, I'm from the tropics. (2) Dobby: ""HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!"" - ""Harry"" as an adjective means to harass. So, I suppose I'll take it as a pun. - 54% (1) '""Mistletoe,"" said Luna dreamily, pointing ... over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under it. ""Good thinking ... It’s often infested with nargles.""' - I'd ship Harry and Luna. (2) Ron: ""What does she see in Krum?"" Harry: ""I suppose he’s older, isn’t he ... and he’s an international Quidditch player."" Ron: ""Yeah, but apart from that."" - Ron's too obvious sometimes. - 58% (1) Harry: ""Are they doctors?"" Ron: ""Doctors? ... Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?"" - Ron's descriptions of the Muggle world never ceases to be a treat. (2) Arthur: ""I was just reading about Willy Widdershins’s arrest ... You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer?"" - Well, that's a loose end I never expected to be tied up. - 62% (1) Arthur: ""Well, I don’t know whether you know what — what stitches are?"" Molly: ""It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back together ... but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid —"" - I guess Ron takes after his mother. (2) ""Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into his pocket."" - One of the most poignant lines in the entire series. - 63% (1) Hermione gets Harry and Ron homework planners for Christmas, which is kind of like gifting someone a diet book... it sends a message. (2) '""I want you to take this,"" [Sirius] said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands. ""What is it?"" Harry asked.' - It's Chekhov's Gun... uh, Chekhov's book-sized package. - 66% (1) Neville should have been the one to kill Bellatrix. Would have been justice for torturing his parents to insanity. (2) I figure with a name like Madame Puddifoot, your career options are rather limited. Either be the proprietor of a girly tea house or a shop for comfortable women's shoes. (3) Seems like Hermione withholds information from Ron just to see him beg. - 68% (1) '""Women!"" [Harry] muttered angrily.' - Well, that's what you get for dating your student. (2) ""Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of firewhisky."" - Teatime's a bit early for firewhiskey. (3) Hermione: ""Harry, you’re worse than Ron... Well, no, you’re not."" - Ron, still champion of not being able to read girls' romantic signals. - 70% (1) Harry to Snape: ""Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that."" - It's misdirection. Have the villains all do one thing and cast doubt on an ally by having him do the same. (2) Trelawny: ""You c-can’t sack me! I’ve b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!"" Umbridge: ""It was your home."" - Cold-hearted. *character limit",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
"Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry’s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM! The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he’s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there’s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy’s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like “We can’t tell you anything about what we’ve been doing, and we’ve been doing A LOT. But don’t worry, we’ll see you soon, we just can’t tell you when”? As if he hasn’t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what’s going on, it’s Harry. Doesn’t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what’s best for him better than he does? And that’s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children’s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child’s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren’t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn’t infallible. James Potter isn’t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn’t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that’s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George’s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry’s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn’t sunshine and roses and you don’t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don’t get the sense that Sirius’s death was a righteous one. You don’t get resolution. He didn’t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I don’t necessarily ""enjoy"" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above. | | | |",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
"“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?"" ""Yes."" ""You called her a liar?"" ""Yes."" ""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?"" ""Yes."" ""Have a seat cause we bloody need to talk about trans lives."" I love Harry Potter as much as anyone, which is why I urge everyone who spends money on these books to also support the trans community. To say it with the author's words: “If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” Well. Here’s a list of organisations that support trans lives (feel free to reach out and recommend more).

"""Galloping gargoyles!"" ""Hang on. This Lord Voldything's back, you say."" When a book gets too long, there's always the risk of giving up halfway, or start skimming through parts. I think, The Order of Phoenix qualifies as long (the version I read had around a 1000 pages), but I wish it to be even longer. Only Rowling can do that. I didn't find one boring bit, or anything out of place. We are reaching a near-perfect level of writing here at the fifth of the series, which, in my opinion, is an excellent concoction of suspense, hope, triumph, disappointment, humor, anger, happiness, sadness and so many others. ""I've always wanted to try firewhisky -"" Right from the beginning, you'll find everything to be intriguing as always, with an excellent set of new characters being introduced. The main characters around Harry are of course the main focus, and the narration inherits a lot from how the teenage Harry views the world. Average emotional rollercoaster of a teenager blends in nicely with the main plot, and makes things more interesting. ""Ask us no questions and we'll tell you no lies,"" We've finally moved in to the core of the story, and an-action-packed story is being unfolded - full of dark times - with no more holding back. If it wasn't for Rowling's writing, this might've felt like one complex story, not to mention how unbearable it would've been with Umbrige, and also with Lestrange and Fudge closely behind. But everything's put in place perfectly, and even the annoying characters do their part really well. And the ending chapters - though disappointing - are the best and most dramatic in the series so far. This has been one amazing ride, while proving the 'Last-is-Best' still to be true.

"Despite this being the longest book in the series, I read it quicker than all the others. Here’s three things I really loved about it: 1. Harry and Sirius- they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry’s development, a few wise words from a sincere friend (or godfather) can go a real long way. And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: 2. Dumbledore’s Army- Harry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they’ve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point. 3. Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people. Luna’s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she’s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. The world needs more Luna Lovegoods. I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did.",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
"I am always ready to pop off on anyone who says they don’t like this book because “Harry is so angsty and annoying in it.” Well, why don’t you watch a peer die right next to you, witness Adolf Hitler’s resurrection, have a trusted adult admit they’ve been lying and manipulating you, and then get sent home for three months to live with people who loathe you, all while being ghosted by the people you actually like for weeks AND SEE HOW WELL YOU DEAL WITH IT. On top of all of that, you’ve got a government publishing daily articles detailing why you’re a crazy person with an overactive imagination and to pay no attention to that 100% alive noseless man behind the curtains. DON’T EVEN WITH ME ON THIS. Also, I still remember reading this book on my bunk bed in 8th grade the day it came out. Never in my life had I experienced so much fiery rage toward a fictional character.

"This book really made my CRY. And it was not just tears, I was CRYING out loud.

Padfoot, Prongs and Moony, what else can I ask for?) and ""The Centaur and the Sneak"" (Dumbledore was AWESOME in this one!).

"EDIT: I have close bonds with several transgender people, and I do not support this author at this point, as she actively uses her financial power to wreak havoc on the lives of trans people. ⭐️In Defense of Harry Potter: Order of the Pheonix So this is my second favorite book of Harry Potter. And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban. This book will make you cry. ⭐️Interlude: In Defense of Harry's Angst Phase Harry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant. Return To Actual Review J.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. Order of the Pheonix is so dark and yet so hopeful . It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much The plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so human and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville. The side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. There's something incredibly powerful in Harry Potter, who has worked alone the last few books, needing to ask for help. Harry realizes that he doesn't have to be alone . This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? “I forgo–” “LUCKY YOU” This book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge. I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort? IT UNSCREWS THE OTHER WAY. This book is just fucking perfect. My mother is giving me annoyed looks while reading this review on her goodreads app but I don't care, this book is perfect.",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
"Complete 5 Golden Stars! & so many more! such a long year, with that old toad! full of ups & downs, Dark times & Rebelling. & with such an integrity, the mystery unfolds. (this last part is about the whole HP plot of course *winks*) Perfection! Another Amazing story in the wizarding world of Harry Potter! it's strange that our favourites change when we get older. This book became my favourite after my long distance with Harry Potter (2014?). & I totally love it right now! (though I loved it before too, but that Umbridge made me sooooooooo angryyyy! & 4 & 2 are still my top favourites. but this one also been added at the top of the list.) Probably the Darkest time at Hogwarts. Harry had hard times (from the first to the last) in different sort of ways; angry, under pressure, self-struggling, mad, sad. I understood how he felt; I was angry with him, at the ministry's reaction & how they treated him after all he'd been through, it was not fair. But he stood up for what was right, the truth, not the sweet lies, or what was easy; even if he would be punished. He didn't back away from his words, just because those idiots didn't like it. (that's why I like the heroes; strong, brave, standing up for what is right) I was sad with him. My heart was broken for him. the World's getting darker . more pressure on Harry. The world we know is changing. How marvelous everything have been designed, described. Magnificent, unique choices of words. & how beautifully (& emotionally) this book ended! graceful! I love the whole school year, like every other books, all those lessons, interesting subjects with fun, pressure & sarcasm. ❤ Beside the concept of the story itself, I always love Hogwarts. I'm pretty sure we all do. beside walking in those spectacular corridors, eating in the Great Hall, exploring the castle & wandering on the grounds, all those interesting magical lessons. Many secrets revealed through this book for us & for the characters. just 'the hearing' parts was a bit dull, but re-reading in many years of being a potterhead, made me start to like it. (& by the whole fascinating & breathtaking plot, I could easily ignore that.) - why this book is my favorite too, in details: 🟇 the humor in the first chapters, made by Sassy Harry. (I'm still mad they didn't put in the movie!) 𝓢𝓪𝓻𝓬𝓪𝓼𝓶 retorts between Harry & Malfoy, always one of the best parts These parts are always made me laugh hard. [& in the Audiobook by Stephen Fry, especially at this part, I doubled over! that was Fantastic! his voice, changing for every character or situation, the drawling voice of Malfoys & ringings in his voice to perform dialogues, the pauses & ups & downs in narrating; which made the story even more awesome!] 🟇 seeing many old lovable characters again! (which I was sure we would see them again, but I didn't know when & looking forward to them to come again & when it happened I was joyful, enthralled!) 🟇 Best moments awards goes to *dramatic pause* D.A.! happy Harry! Rebellious Harry! Sarcastic Harry! don't forget, 🟇 Sassy Harry all over the book! ""Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life?"" 🟇 Weasley twins! ""Give her hell from us, Peeves!"" 🟇 Jokes along with pressures by every characters. “Ron,"" said Hermione in a dignified voice, ""you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.” 🟇 Grawp! 🟇 Weasley is our King! 🟇 Impressive Professor McGonagall! “Have a biscuit, Potter.” “Are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores?” 🟇 Marauders! 🟇 James & Sirius one of my favourite Brotps! 🟇 Golden & Silver trio! 🟇 the third side appeared & how Harry is under more pressure from every directions. 🟇 the battles at the end of the book! I love how different (comparing to \other ends) & how brilliantly shocking & exciting it was! 🟇 heart-breaking, soul-crushing moments! 🟇 aaaaand the truth we've been waiting for has been unfolded. 🟇 I loved O.W.L chapter, beside the whole thrills & fun, Harry's, Ron's & Hermione's reaction about the exams were so relatable (& realistic). plus, it seemed like a real magical education! Last minutes revision! Might doze off in studying (history) after a long night being awake. He should know the answer, he had read it just this morning. The exam questions reminded me of myself being student & having national exams at some of my educational years. The bonus point. (I loved the bonus points in the exams XD) 2019 : I also like Luna now. 2020 : always feels good to finish a Harry Potter on Christmas eve.

"This is my new routine to reread HP books to take a trip down my memory lane because reading these remarkable books make me remember the times I was so excited to get my hands on them: the younger, crazier, stupider, less experienced, naiver but always happy version of myself. These books always bring out the noisy, mischievous, fiery, cheery child we hid inside the walls as we grow up. But right now, I totally agree that we need revisions and new perspectives as the world changes: we definitely need spinoffs!

"❝Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.❞ Rating: ★ ★ ★ ¾ I feel like I'm going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3.75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far. It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix. On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either. Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned. As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more. Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books.",4.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2

"“I’ve had enough, I’ve seen enough, I want out, I want it to end, I don’t care any more—” The ending this book was too emotional. Heartbreaking in every way what Harry has gone through and had to endure. ———————————— 100th reread. I’m exaggerating. I don’t know what number I’m on. Rowling is such a gifted storyteller and incredible at creating characters with distinct voices. I'm appreciating the world-building a lot more now as well. She crafted it beautifully throughout the series. - Harry’s grief was palpable and it hurt. A lot. - Harry and Cho’s relationship was boring as hell. - Dumbledore is my favourite character ever. He’s open with his mistakes and the way he came to care and protect Harry warmed my soul right up. - Umbridge is worse than Voldemort. Son of a witch. - Fudge should’ve died. - As well as Percy.",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
"English ( ) / Italiano «The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four» The ""big number 5"", the longest novel of Harry Potter series, begins... ""HolyMadonna, how big is this book?"" my daughter says, without fear for the number of pages, she looked more excited for the opening of this new adventure. And it starts with a bang, with two dementors attacking Harry and his cousin Dudley in a muggles area, out in the open. The rules of the usual Rowling's game have definitely changed. . The axiom ""before we'll be between the welcoming arms of Hogwarts, and after many things will happen"" no longer exists. The previous chapter of the series, also, started in the spirit of this new trend: you're not safe anywhere. Everything is more complicated for Harry Potter, it is difficult even to sleep by now. «There is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there» Let's talk frankly, the entire novel revolves around this room and what's on it, and there are numerous signs and things said that make me think that we will be back on the argument in the future. In fact, despite a series of revelations came about this room at the end of the novel, an air of mystery remains. And sadness remains too. So much sadness. Vote: 9 «Il giorno più caldo dell'estate – almeno fino a quel momento – volgeva al termine e un silenzio sonnacchioso gravava sulle grandi case quadrate di Privet Drive. Le automobili di solito scintillanti sostavano impolverate nei vialetti e i prati un tempo verde smeraldo si stendevano incartapecoriti e giallognoli, perché l'irrigazione era stata proibita a causa della siccità. In mancanza delle loro consuete occupazioni – lavare l'auto e falciare il prato – gli abitanti di Privet Drive si erano rintanati nella penombra delle loro case fresche, con le finestre spalancate nella speranza di indurre una brezza inesistente a entrare. La sola persona rimasta all'aperto era un adolescente che giaceva lungo disteso sulla schiena in un'aiuola fuori dal numero quattro» Comincia il ""big 5"" di Harry Potter, il volume più lungo della serie. ""O Madonnamia quanto è gigante"" , dice mia figlia quando lo vede, per nulla spaventata dalla mole, anzi eccitata da questa nuova avventura che sta per iniziare. E comincia col botto, con due dissennatori che aggrediscono Harry e il cugino Dudlley in piena terra babbana, alla luce del sole. Sono definitivamente cambiate le regole del gioco della Rowling al quale eravamo abituati in precedenza, ossia prima si arriva tra le accoglienti mura di Hogwarts e poi succedono tante cose. Non più. Già il capitolo precedente della saga era iniziato all'insegna del nuovo trend potteriano: non si è più al sicuro da nessuna parte. Per Harry è tutto sempre più complicato, gli riesce difficile perfino dormire in santa pace. «Nell'Ufficio Misteri c'è una stanza che viene tenuta sempre chiusa. Contiene una forza al tempo stesso più meravigliosa e più terribile della morte, dell'intelligenza umana e della natura. E forse il più misterioso fra i molti soggetti che vengono studiati laggiù» Parliamoci francamente, l'intero romanzo ruota attorno a questa stanza e a quello che contiene, e ci sono molteplici indizi e mezze frasi dette che mi fanno pensare che si ritornerà a parlare di essa, tentando di chiarirne l'essenza misteriosa, che però permane nonostante tutta una serie di rivelazioni a fine romanzo. E permane tristezza. Tanta tristezza. Voto: 9",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
"Now we've entered the start of the not-so-happy arc. I don't even want to think about the ending. I would much prefer to reread the first four books again than suffer (vicariously) through that ending with Harry. The twins antics keeps the book from becoming too depressing and Professor Umbridge is simply divine as the Big Bad. On a side note, ever think J K Rowling just wants to give sage advice to her kids and wrote an entire book to cover that up? Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young. We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.

"Guys, this was so much better than the movie. I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one. Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series. The ending of Goblet of Fire is quite dark, but I felt book #5 is where the series really gets down to business and loses the childlike innocence that it clasped tightly for some long. What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does. Only two more to go, which makes me quite sad, but also excited to find out how they compare to the rest!",4.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
"I can already feel my mother’s stare even before she sees me rereading this book for the third time lol I AM THAT OBSESSED WITH HARRY POTTER. Don’t judge me pleaseee 🫣 •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• SECOND TIME READ: *phew* FINALLY I FINISHED READING IT. I mean, I liked this book but wow it's slow and it's not as interesting as the previous books. But still, I liked it. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• FIRST TIME READ Edit : Rounded it up into 5 stars REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW Edit : Guys, I'm sorry that I have to review it on Monday. There's blackout here ;_; 4.9 Stars 'Yeah' said Harry, 'but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.' I supposed to post the review yesterday but there was a blackout while I was reviewing and you can imagine how pissed I was when suddenly my computer was off and the review was already quite long. I was like this : well, I wasn't screaming because it was midnight but I was really really angry. well let's talk about this book :D *breaths in Breaths out* there were lots of tears, laugh, sadness, happiness and anger while I was reading it and I'm here still can't accept the death of the guy I cared care. I mean, why do I always lose charcters that I love or care?!?! why Sirius?! not Kreacher or anyone, anyone means Cho Chang actually... okay let's begin with Cho Chang. I Ship Harry With Ginny Not Cho Chang I totally HATE this girl. She is a cry baby and she is also weird. one minute she is happy and then suddenly she bursts into tears and she always exaggerate problems. little problem can be big problem with her and I still don't know why Harry had feelings to her. yes, had. because he doesn't like Cho Chang anymore. YAY! finally he opened his eyes! and these scenes made me hate her so much : ➜ He turned to saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face. ➜ 'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'd u - u - understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d - didn't you?' ➜ 'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain. ➜ 'I'm really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.' ➜ 'That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Chp fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list -' 'I think it was brilliant idea,' said harry coldly, Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter. 'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea -' 'Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly. 'I wasn't going to! she shouted. 'Yeah ... well ... good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cop with at the moment.' 'Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off. ➜ 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Cho's face when Ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose?' 'I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly, 'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though ...' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?' and she was totally insane, why did she have to ask about Cedric to Harry while they were dating. of course Harry didn't want to talk abou Cedric! and Didn't she have feelings?! I'm sure Harry didn't want to remember that horrible memory. I ship Harry with Ginny because : ❤ Ginny is funny ❤ Ginny is not a crybaby ❤ Ginny is brave ❤ Ginny is more beautiful than Cho ❤ She is basically more perfect than Cho I Don't Like Harry's Temper I know, Harry was having a hard time but that didn't mean he had the rights to be harsh to his best friends. they will always on his side and there was a scene where he snapped at Hermione. 'Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?' Harry said loudly. 'No,' said Hermione calmly. 'I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side.' There was a short pause. 'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice. 'That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. 'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?' and they continued talking. oh! I also didn't like Harry when he shouted at professor Dumbledore because he just saved his life and he's clearly older than Harry, So Harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed Dumbledore's possessions. he was totally rude I know, I know he was sad because Sirius just died and I was sad too! I cried a lot! but I didn't angry with Dumbledore. I was angry with Kreacher, Bellatrix and Voldemort. I still am, actually. how could I forgive them?! they killed Sirius! I Love Sirius Especially Young Sirius With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed. OH.MY.GOD. HE IS SO HANDSOME. BUT WHY!?! WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?!?! I LIKE SIRIUS SO MUCH!! AND NOW, I WILL NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE! LIFE IS SO UNFAIR. thank you for reading and liking this review, guys! hope you guys have a great day! ❤❤ P.S. I like Luna so much! she is funny xD",,,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)",2
