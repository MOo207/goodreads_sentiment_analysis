"After reading Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , I realized that I had absolutely nothing to say about it. And yet here, as you see, I have elected to say it anyway, and at great length. Reading this novel now, at the age of mumble-mumble, is a bit like arriving at the circus after the tents have been packed, the bearded lady has been depilated, and the funnel cake trailers have been hitched to pick-up trucks and captained, like a formidable vending armada, toward the auburn sunset. All the fun has already been used up, and I’m left behind circumnavigating the islands of elephant dung and getting drunk on Robitussin®. Same story, different day. How exactly did I make it through eight total years of high school and undergraduate studies in English without having read any Mark Twain but a brief (and forgotten) excerpt from Life on the Mississippi ? Isn’t this illegal by now? I mean, isn’t there a clause in the Patriot Act... an eleventh commandment... a dictate from Xenu? Isn’t Huckleberry Finn , like Romeo and Juliet and To Kill a Mockingbird , now an unavoidable teenage road bump between rainbow parties and huffing spray paint? Isn’t it the role of tedious classic literature to add color and texture to the pettiness of an adolescence circumscribed by status updates, muff shaving, and shooting each other? Or am I old-fashioned? Let’s face it. In the greater social consciousness, there are two stars of this book: (1) the word 'nigger' and (2) the Sherwood Schwartz-style ending in which Tom Sawyer reappears and makes even the most casual reader wonder whether he might not be retarded. Huckleberry Finn, for all his white trash pedigree, is actually a pretty smart kid -- the kind of dirty-faced boy you see, in his younger years, in a shopping cart at Wal-Mart, being barked at by a monstrously obese mother in wedgied sweatpants and a stalagmite of a father who sweats tobacco juice and thinks the word 'coloreds' is too P.C. Orbiting the cart, filled with generic cigarette cartons, tabloids, and canned meats, are a half-dozen kids, glazed with spittle and howling like Helen Keller over the water pump, but your eyes return to the small, sad boy sitting in the cart. His gaze, imploring, suggestive of a caged intellect, breaks your heart, so you turn and comparison-shop for chewing gum or breath mints. He is condemned to a very dim horizon, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it, so you might as well buy some Altoids and forget about it... That boy is the spiritual descendant of Huckleberry Finn. The 'nigger' controversy -- is there still one? -- is terribly inconsequential. It almost seems too obvious to point out that this is (a) firstly a 'period novel,' meaning it that occurs at a very specific historical moment at a specific location and (b) secondly a first-person narrative, which is therefore saddled with the language, perspective, and nascent ideologies of its narrator. Should we expect a mostly uneducated, abused adolescent son of a racist alcoholic who is living in the South before the Civil War to have a respectful, intellectually-enlightened perspective toward black people? Should the character of Huck Finn, in other words, be ahistorical, anachronistic? Certainly not, if we expect any semblance of honesty from our national literature. Far more troubling to many critics is the ending of Huckleberry Finn , when -- by a freakishly literary coincidence -- Huck Finn is mistaken for Tom Sawyer by Tom’s relatives, who happen to be holding Jim (the slave on the run) in hopes of collecting a reward from his owners. There are all sorts of contrivances in this scenario -- the likes of which haven’t been seen since the golden age of Three’s Company -- which ends with Tom arriving and devising a ridiculously elaborate scheme for rescuing Jim. All in all, the ending didn’t bother me as much as it bothered some essayists I’ve read. That is, it didn’t strike me as especially conspicuous in a novel which relies a great deal on narrative implausibility and coincidence. Sure, Tom Sawyer is something of an idiot, as we discover, but in a novel that includes faked deaths and absurd con jobs, his idiocy seems well-placed. In the end, I suppose the greatest thing I can say about this novel is that it left me wondering what happened to Huck Finn. Would his intellect and compassion escape from his circumstances or would he become yet another bigoted, abusive father squiring another brood of dirty, doomed children around a fluorescently-lit Wal-Mart?",4.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"This is a rant. I found Huckleberry Finn on my bookshelf had been changed to Huckleberry Finn Robotic Edition. Some very pc ""authors"" and ""editors"" took it upon themselves to change the N word to 'robot'. They then rewrote the book to take away any mention of humans and to 'roboticise' words such as 'eye' which becomes something like 'optical device'. The illustrations have also been changed. I have no problem with this, but I do have two major issues with this edition. The first problem is with the librarians who think think this is close enough to the original that it should be combined and therefore share the ratings of Mark Twain's original book. There was a long discussion in the librarian thread where some librarians thought it was essentially the same book, perhaps most. So it was combined and the edition of the book I read was changed to that one. I DID NOT read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Robotic Edition. This robot edition was a Kindle book. Think about it and the danger of these 'authors'. If this is acceptable and it is to a lot of the librarians, why not politically correct Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Agatha Christie (oh she's been done already. It was 10 Little N words, then 10 Little Indians, now it's Then there were 10, lol). Sooner or later print books will be in used bookshops, research libraries and old people's houses. They will become not books to be read but collector's items. For reading it will be the ebook where changes can be easily and instantaneously made. And if politically-correcting everything becomes Amazon policy then the whole publishing world will follow and your children will never know the original story that Mark Twain wrote. They will never understand how N word people were treated and that is my second issue with this pc book. They will never know that Jim, a grown man would not normally be expected to hang out with 13 year old boys, kowtowed to Tom and Huckleberry not just because they all liked each other, but because he was not free, he was a slave, property, and was subject to the usual treatment of property. He could be ordered to do anything no matter how stupid or harmful, he could be sold or mistreated not even for punishment but just because he had no human rights whatsoever. Changing N people to robots negates all this. Yes it is more politically acceptable to Whites but how would a Black person feel having their history taken away from them? This is not pc as much as sanitising history and is wrong on every level. And it was done by the authors to make it easier for White teachers to teach this important book (is it important if it is about robots though?) without engendering awkward discussions about race, slavery, why some people have rights and others are property which has also meant the book is on many 'banned' school lists. Do you find this acceptable? A lot of GR librarians don't see a damn thing wrong with it. But I do. See edited 27 Jan 2018",5.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"Hemingway said American fiction begins and ends with Huck Finn , and he's right. Twain's most famous novel is a tour de force. He delves into issues such as racism, friendship, war, religion, and freedom with an uncanny combination of lightheartedness and gravitas. There are several moments in the book that are hilarious, but when I finished the book, I knew I had read something profound. This is a book that everyone should read.",5.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"The ugly face of slavery and racism Described in detail by one of the big storytellers Twain just had the intuition and talent to create a milestone of enlightening literature, showing humankind its worst flaws by not moralizing, proselytizing, and thereby boring the audience. Instead, all the atrocities are shown in the actions, mentalities, and especially dialogues of the Bigoted and primitive people of that time That deem themselves superior, smart, and just sheer Übermensch. Many works against slavery, fascism, extremism, and faith use that storytelling trick of making the hatemongering trolls, the stupid, uneducated antagonistic people of that time, ridiculous in contrast to the progressive, sophisticated protagonists. In the case of Huckleberry Finn Everyone except the protagonist is evil Because the norms, rules, and laws of the time allow them to be. That´s the subject Twain isn´t directly pointing his finger at, but the underlying core of the tale, that opportunity makes thieves. And a society based on exploitation and brutality creates inhuman, full citizen status subjects with all democratic human rights that treat anyone inferior like an animal and worse than their dogs. That´s A scheme as old as history And Twain digs deeper into it in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court He goes above the average evil citizen and describes the ones, kings, god emperors, and faith fueled fanatics, who want this mess to better rule the mad masses. One of the, subjective, main reasons why Huckleberry is so much more successful than the Yankee is that it´s easier to read about bad people doing unfriendly things without directly attacking the system itself. The Yankee does this in a satiric way and is even today just too uncomfortable for people who believe that everything is fine. This Humor and irony are the final ingredients Other great works against slavery are mind opening and well written too, but come with a depressing and hopeless undertone. Twain doesn´t just deliver the important messages, but he does it in combination with creating hilarious dialogues, motivations, and character evolutions that combine deep thoughts and giggles. When first reading Twain as a teenager I didn´t get that, I didn´t see the ingenuity of the whole plot that permanently delivers deep and cynical, postmodern social satire with tons of dark comedy elements. Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:",4.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"Mark Twain tells us the story of Huckleberry Finn and Jim, who attempts to free themselves from society's restraints in this book. The racism aspect of this novel is one of the most discussed and debated topics. The readers will have to encounter the N-word multiple times, which can be difficult for many people. The beauty of this book is that it can be viewed from various angles. The theme of how black and white people work together for their quest for freedom has inspired many people. There are many more layers to this book, including the empathy facet, which is not discussed in depth compared to the racism aspect. It is sad to see some people just considering it as a young adult book discussing racism which just high school children should read. This is unequivocally a true classic that all should read due to the author's exceptional writing skills and multiple embedded themes in it. “Right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and knows better.”",5.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652

"HUCK IL SELVAGGIO Il film più recente è del 1993 diretto da Stephen “La Mummia” Sommers. Huck è un giovanissimo Elijah Wood, otto anni prima della Trilogia dell’Anello, e suo padre nella foto è Ron Perlman. Romanzo d’avventure, romanzo di formazione, Huckleberry Finn è forse il Grande Romanzo Americano, come e più di Moby Dick. È così almeno per Hemingway che del libro di Twain scrisse: Tutta la letteratura moderna americana deriva da un libro di Mark Twain intitolato Huckleberry Finn. La scrittura americana arriva da lì. Non c’era mai stato niente del genere prima. E non c’è più stato più niente del genere dopo . Viene infatti da dire che è così almeno nella lingua: ben più ‘sporca’, ben più quotidiana, ‘moderna’ e impregnata della terra di quella di Melville. Huck e lo schiavo in fuga Jim. L’avventura c’è eccome, la formazione non saprei, forse no: perché Huck fugge per essere libero, per vivere come vuole, e alla fine è costretto a tornare indietro e rientrare in quella civiltà che rifiuta, dalla quale voleva allontanarsi e separarsi. Alla fine è sconfitto, ma non domo. Me ne stavo all’aria tutto il giorno, felice e contento, fumavo e pescavo e non studiavo mai. Così sono passati un paio di mesi e i miei vestiti sono tornati gli stracci sozzi di sempre, e io non riuscivo più a capire come mai m’era piaciuto dalla vedova, dove bisognava lavarsi, mangiare nel piatto, pettinarsi, andare a letto e alzarsi regolare e starsene sempre con un libro in mano con Miss Watson che rompeva tutto il tempo. Non volevo più tornarci. Avevo smesso di dire parolacce perché alla vedova non gli piaceva, ma adesso avevo ricominciato perché papà non aveva niente in contrario. Lassù nei boschi, tutto sommato, me la spassavo proprio. La versione di Michael “Casablanca” Curtiz del 1960. Sulla zattera insiem a Huck e Jim il Duca e il Re. Nella sua fuga il ragazzino naviga per il grande fiume Mississippi ed è istintivo pensare al fiume Congo, a Conrad e il suo Marlow, a quel cuore di tenebra che sembra riverberare in questo lungo e maestoso fiume americano dove anche Huck incontra gente ben selvaggia, più selvaggia di lui stesso. Fa poca differenza se il viaggio di uno è a risalire il corso d’acqua verso la sorgente e il suo cuore nero, quello dell’altro è invece a scendere verso la foce. E quando sull’isola deserta del fiume incontra lo schiavo nero Jim, che è fuggito alle catene, e lo porta con sé sulla zattera, come non pensare a Robinson Crusoe e Venerdì? In un mondo di adulti da evitare, sorta di feccia umana, violenti truffaldini lestofanti oppure bigotti e oppressivi, l’unico adulto che si salva è proprio lo schiavo nero Jim. Nella violenza del padre ubriacone che tiene chiuso e sequestrato il figlio come non ritrovare le figure di padri e tutori e maschi adulti che mettevano i brividi nei romanzi di Dickens? Nel film di Michael Curtiz del 1960 Buster Keaton nella parte di Lion Tamer. Romanzo d’avventura e (forse) di formazione, dicevo: ma anche romanzo picaresco per ragazzi e per adulti, pagine che parlano a grandi e piccini. Romanzo sulla fuga. Sulla libertà. Tom Sawyer, l’amico di sempre e delle altre avventure negli altri romanzi, uno prima e uno dopo questo, è un monello che alla fine accetta la civiltà e impara le regole: non così Huck, che rimane selvaggio – il suo viaggio nella civiltà è in realtà un viaggio attraverso la moderna inciviltà. Nell’edizione originale del 1884 ecco l’incontro tra Huck e Jim. Ci sono ovviamente altri livelli di lettura, meno diretti ai ragazzi e più agli adulti, come si addice a un grande romanzo: Huck mette in scena la sua morte, rinuncia alla sua identità per essere libero, dalla morte nasce la sua vita. E quindi una partenza ben nera. Come nero è Jim, nero il fiume percorso soprattutto di notte sotto le stelle, nero il mondo degli adulti (bianchi), nera la civiltà da cui è meglio tenersi alla larga, fuggire, nera la modernità, a cominciare proprio dagli Stati Uniti. Nera è la morale e nere sono le regole di questi adulti, del loro mondo ‘civile’ e ‘moderno’… Huckleberry Finn in un disegno di E.W. Kemble dell'edizione originale 1884 del libro. È bello vivere su una zattera. Il cielo, lassù, era tutto tempestato di stelle, e noi ci sdraiavamo sulla schiena a guardarle e discutevamo se le aveva fatte qualcuno o se erano capitate lì per caso: Jim pensava che le aveva fatte qualcuno, io invece che erano capitate lì per caso – ci voleva troppo tempo per fare tutte quelle stelle. Jim ha detto che forse le aveva covate la luna, e a me mi sembrava sensato, così non ho detto niente anche perché avevo visto una rana covare altrettanti ranocchi e perciò era possibile. Guardavamo anche le stelle cadenti e le scie che si lasciavano dietro. Jim diceva che erano guaste e così le buttavano fuori dal nido.

"Too Serious, Too Slow The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was fun while Huck Finn has a more somber tone. The pacing was also off and seemed to drag. For the record, by Percival Everett significantly departs from this book. Apparently, he too fell asleep in the last half of the book and decided to take the story in a different direction.

"We catched fish, and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn’t often that we laughed, only a kind of low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next, nor the next. ~~~ Selected by Me for August 2021 Big Book Read (In August I am reading the entire as well as & ) Buddy Read with Aesaan Random thought: The more I read the more I believe this is my very favorite book. I grow to love it more with each repeated reading. In 1876, began writing The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , the sequel to his widely popular novel . After eight years of reworking ~~ and sometimes destroying ~~ the manuscript, the novel was published. Fans of its predecessor were surprised to find that Huck Finn was not the romantic depiction of southern boyhood that Tom Sawyer was. Instead, the novel was a realistic look at the hypocrisy and senselessness of southern society. Huck Finn tells the story of a young boy searching for freedom and identity in this backwards society. It’s hard for many Americans to accept a simple truth ~~ American history is not always pretty. There are atrocities we don’t like to be reminded of. For over 135 years, ’s has held up that mirror and challenged us to examine our souls. When Huck Finn was first introduced in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , he was Tom’s untamed friend, the one who was always ready to play hooky and look for pirate treasure; the friend Tom could always trust to follow him without question. In his own story, Huck takes over as narrator with his distinctive voice, sharing with the reader not only his escapades since fleeing his abusive father, but also his growing philosophy about slavery and the changing country around him. In many ways Huckleberry Finn is the story of Jim , the runaway slave who accompanies Huck on his adventures, as much as it is Huck’s story. A complicated character, Jim goes from silly to tragic, sometimes even within the same paragraph. He dreams of freedom, not just for himself but for his wife and children, sharing with Huck his desire to purchase each of them back ~~ and if he can’t buy them back, he’ll steal them. To help emphasize the heartbreak of Jim’s plight, Huck witnesses a family split up by a slave auction. Those around Huck are upset by it too, and their inaction speaks volumes. has been one of the most banned books in America. From complaints about its use of foul language and stereotypes, to being a bad influence on children, this book has never escaped controversy. While re-reading it again this go around, I wondered who exactly did Twain picture as his audience. Sometimes it feels like a young boy’s adventure, others it reads as a dour tale for adults. Yes, Huck dresses up like a girl and gets in comic misadventures, but this is more a novel about slavery, beatings, child abuse, alcoholism and murder. Huck’s America, much like 45’s America, is not a friendly one. Viewing the novel as merely a contemporary tale of Twain’s time, it is masterful how he handles Jim for that reader. Twain begins by hitting all of the stereotypes Americans of that period would have expected, then he builds on the character until he emerges as a hero, sacrificing his freedom to carry an injured white boy to safety. It is a subtle and brilliant statement against racism and for equality. Lastly, Huckleberry Finn is a book about transitions. These transitions can be seen in the intermediate setting between transitions in which the novel takes place, Huck’s disenchantment with society over the course of the novel, and Huck’s moral maturation. is filled with all sorts of transitions for Huck. Throughout the entire novel, Huck is in a state of Limbo. He’s fourteen years old, an awkward stage after childhood and before adulthood ~~ in the throes of puberty, while he’s floating down the Mississippi River, the boundary between individual freedom and an immature civilization. Huck transitions from a boy being civilized in St. Petersburg, Missouri, to a young man completely disenchanted with society. Finally, he transitions from being indoctrinated by southern morality to accepting his own individual morals and heading off to free Jim. Huck is constantly changing over the course of the novel. He starts out as the immature Missouri boy playing jokes on slaves, but by the end he is an enlightened young man ready to head west to a better tomorrow. Huckleberry Finn is the future of America. Update 2022: I just completed my annual reading. I love the character of Huck so much. Update 2023: It's amazing all the little things I picked up with this read. Twain is so good. Update 2025: I just completed my annual reading. This novel is nearly perfect. It remains the perfect summer read.",5.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"“Jim talked out loud about freedom, while I worried silently and tried to decide what I should do. Jim said that the first thing that he would do when he was a free man in a Free State was work and save every cent of his money until he had enough to buy his wife out of slavery. Then they would both work until they could buy their two children, or maybe they would get Abolitionists to steal the children for them. I became sick with guilt when I heard Jim say those words. He would never have dared talk of stealing his children before and was saying that now only because he felt he was almost free. I was helping Jim run away and he was talking about stealing his children – children who belonged to a man that I had never met, a man who had never done me harm. I was sorry to hear Jim say those words; it was such a lowering of himself. I felt so guilty that I told myself that I would go to shore the first time I saw light and tell someone about Jim. I knew that was the correct thing to do. I felt much better…” -	Mark Twain, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn There is a robust debate about whether The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the greatest American novel, or merely among the best. Whatever it’s ranking, it feels fair to say that Mark Twain’s classic about a black man seeking his freedom, a confabulating white boy finding his conscience, and the mighty Mississippi upon which they travel, is the most American of the great American novels, dealing as it does with the preeminent issue of the nation’s founding, development, and idea of itself: slavery. At the outset of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Twain famously asserts that anyone trying to find a message in the story would be banished. That has not stopped anyone from trying in the 140 years since its publication. It says a lot about the book that so many people have tried to ban it for so many different reasons. Controversies aside, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn takes an unusual approach to its examination of slavery. For one, it is humorous, which is a fascinating prism through which to view one of the least funny aspects of human existence. For another, it deals with slavery indirectly, portraying it as a part of life so ingrained that it is seldom questioned. It is also entirely uninterested in the experiences of the enslaved, who seldom demonstrate much agency. Most importantly, the story is told through the eyes of a child, one who happens to be one of fiction’s least reliable narrators. *** The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , though they are on different planets in terms of theme, structure, and tone. While the former is told in the third person, occurs in and around St. Petersburg (standing in for Hannibal, Missouri), and is a mostly joyous evocation of the sprees of boyhood, the latter is told in the first person, ranges far and wide over the river and countryside, and is about the discovery of an ethical conscience, though the sprees of boyhood eventually intrude. Despite Twain’s warning against the expectation of a plot, a plot there is, though it does not consist of the typical arc of setup, conflict, and resolution. At the outset, we learn we are going to be seeing things through the eyes of young Huckleberry “Huck” Finn, a secondary character in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer who now takes center stage. After a bit of tomfoolery, followed by a bit of child abuse played for laughs, Huck runs away from his troubles, and right into a runaway slave named Jim. Together, the two of them hit the river to deliver Jim to freedom. What follows is an episodic narrative that involves murderers on a sinking boat, a ridiculous family feud played out to the death, and the introduction of two of the most memorable buffoons in literary history: the King and the Duke. *** There are far too many things to say about The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , and most of them have been said already. Twain's desires to the contrary, the deconstructions of this slender book are legion. As such, I’ll try to make this brief. Perhaps the thing that jumps out first is Twain’s use of dialect. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn speaks with a very distinct voice, which tries to capture the rhythms, pronunciations, and idiomatic expressions of the region. According to Twain, he used half a dozen different dialects, with close attention paid to their differences. Regardless of the veracity – Twain did live in this time period, among these people – his attempt to channel what he called “the Missouri negro dialect” has been met with criticism. The charge made here – and against other titles using this technique – is that black men and women are made to talk in ways that are ungrammatical and subservient. This feature is a central target of Percival Everett’s James , a wholesale reimagining of the tale from Jim’s point of view. With space at a premium, I'll note only that everyone speaks in their own way. This isn’t Gone With the Wind , where black people communicate through eye dialect, and all the white people are speaking like English majors at an Ivy League college. In other words, Twain – unlike Margaret Mitchell – does not seem to be using vernacular to pass judgments on intellect. *** Related to the dialect is the use of the N-word, which appears as often as in a Tarantino film. As far as words go, it is probably the most offensive set of letters that exists in the English language. It’s unpleasant to read, and for some, it is understandably a deal breaker. Unfortunately, utterance of the word is also authentic, and Twain’s use of it rather pointed, especially in its casual employment. Every time Huck lets it fly, without even thinking, it is yet another indicator of the deep pervasiveness of racism. For almost every character in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , the degradation of their fellow human beings on the basis of skin color is as natural as breathing. *** It is no spoiler to acknowledge that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is heading – from its first pages – to Huck’s own moral reckoning of the environment he inhabits, and the beliefs he has not heretofore questioned. To Twain’s credit, this is not a simple process. Even by the final pages, it is a subtle evolution. Complicating matters is the tortured endgame that Twain conjures up. In Hollywood’s hands, Huck’s redemption would have followed a straighter line, as it did in Disney’s laudable 1993 rendering. Without giving too much away, the actual conclusion of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is drawn out, absurd, occasionally funny, and extremely uncomfortable. In the late nineteenth century, I can totally imagine that the giddy ridiculousness of the climax acted as a teaspoon of sugar to help the antiracist lecture go down. Today, it veers a bit more toward the psychological torture of an enslaved black man by an up-jumped hillbilly and his somewhat ignorant friend. At the very least, it’s not forgettable. *** The arguments over the meanings of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , and whether it is ultimately an attack on racism or an embrace of it, have played out over the decades in school boards, libraries, and academia. In the end, all those words – including those you just read, or skimmed, or glanced at on your way to something better – are worthless, for this is one of those volumes you need to read on your own, and then decide for yourself.",5.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652

"“Human beings can be awful cruel to one another.” Like many, I’ve read this book when I was a kid (twice actually, as a kid and a teen), and this was the first time I revisited it as a (hopefully) fully functional adult. And this time my reactions to it were quite magnified. The parts I liked before I loved now, and the parts that irked me in childhood now irritated the living daylights out of me. Huckleberry Finn is a classic, and about half of it deserves that designation. Those are the parts where Twain shines — the parts with the mesmerizing and majestic Mississippi river, the ability to write injustice and abuse without proselytizing and falling into “misery porn” trap, and the sharp observation of the folks of the rural American South. “We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn’t often that we laughed – only a little kind of a low chuckle.” And then there are the parts when severe tonal dissonance kicks in and the whiplash of being in another book sets in. It first starts with a bit of annoyance in those endless “king” and “duke” chapters, but peaks at impressive rate once Tom Sawyer and his hijinks pop up. Tom Sawyer, who belongs in a kids book at best, whose overactive imagination in this situation is no longer cute but dangerous and cruel and incredibly thoughtless — and almost physically painful. (Yes, I know Tom Sawyer is supposed to come across as ridiculous here, but it went on for way too long). Oh, and how bleak and pointlessly violent was the world of rural American South of the 1830? Sometimes I wonder if humanity really deserves to continue on. Yes, there are quite a few funny parts (Huck’s rant about Henry VIII many “achievements” - from Domesday book to malmsey wine drowning to Boston Tea Party comes to mind*), but my overall take this time is of resolutely grim life. Slavery, violence, alcoholism, cruelty, ignorance, disregard for rights of others - I need to stare at the wall for a little while now. * My favorite rant here, under spoiler tag for brevity sake: “My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off. 'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'—and they chop it off. 'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S'pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.” Being a novel of its time it doesn’t go where I wish it did, but even classics belong to their time, and this one is not an exception. And people needed to start like Huck — deciding that ”All right, then, I'll GO to hell” — because you have to start somewhere. 3.5 stars, and my brain is busily editing Tom Sawyer out of this story). ———— Buddy read with Nastya . —————— Also posted on .",3.0,neutral,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"I had mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it's clear that Mark Twain was progressive for his day, satirizing the topsy-turvy morals of the slavery-era south. His heroes are two people at the bottom rung of the social ladder - a runaway slave, and the son of the town drunk. Though they're not valued by society, they turn out to be the two most honorable characters of the book. And I appreciated the questions it raised, about how we construct our own sense of morality in the context of broader social morals, and how we deal with potential conflicts between those two. I loved Huck for choosing to go to hell rather than turn in his friend. On the other hand, it's such a far-fetched farce, with so many over-the-top scenes, one crazy situation after another, so many coincidences, such silliness, that I had a hard time enjoying it. At the end, Tom keeps adding all kinds of superfluous details into the escape plan, just to satisfy his sense of drama. The author seems to think this will be amusing - see how it's a funny game to Tom, see how he's influenced by all the adventure books he's ever read... And I just wanted to smack the kid, and say, ""A man's life is in danger! How dare you treat this like a game of make-believe! Just get him out of there, you idiot!"" The humor reminded me a lot of Candide. That style (social satire, ironic farce, fable, whatever you want to call it) can be a great way to make a point. But it's not the same as a novel with well-developed characters and a realistic plot. Sometimes I enjoy satire, but yesterday, I just wasn't in the mood. I felt like the atrocities committed in our country against African-Americans were just too horrific to laugh at. I have heard that people often protest this book when it appears on school curricula, because of the repeated use of the n-word. I think I had an easier time accepting that word, because it reflected the common usage of the time, and it felt like part of the natural, authentic voice of the narrator. I had a harder time with the portrayal of Jim as a naive, superstitious, gullible, person, who seems completely dependent on a young white boy to figure out what to do. Jim is good, but he doesn’t come across as particularly smart. He's more an archetype - the noble savage - than a real person. I think the main value of this book is as a historical artifact. You can see the important role it played if you look at what it was for the time it was written in, and how it influenced other books written in America. But I don’t think it could get published today. I'm glad to say, we've come a long way.",3.0,neutral,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"I first read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn when I was in high school. I don't remember if it was the full book or an abridged version in a textbook. I only remembered three things about the book. 1. The Explanatory statement at the beginning of the book where Twain talks about dialects and such. 2. Huckleberry and Jim floating down the Mississippi River on a raft. (I definitely didn't remember how their adventure started or ended.) 3. I also remembered that Huck and others frequently used the N-word. (I didn't remember that they used the N-word 219 times!) I reread Huck Finn by listening to the first thirty-two chapters of an audio book narrated by Elijah Wood. Then I read chapters thirty-three through forty-three using a text-based digital copy of the book I obtained from my local library. I started with an audio book because I wanted to get a feel for the various dialects. I almost quit the book early on because I found the use of the N-word so offensive. I decided to continue reading the book after I read the PEN America essay titled Here’s Why Banning ‘Huck Finn’ Over The N-Word Sends The Wrong Message. Huck Finn deals with serious topics such as slavery, child abuse, the flim-flamery we now call ""white"" crime, and the importance of personal loyalty and integrity. The book starts and ends like a humorous YA adventure but like a four star restaurant there's some serious meat and potatoes between the appetizer and dessert. I do have to admit I found the comedic shtick between Tom Sawyer, Huck, and Jim to be tedious. I found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages, and finally chapters. Tom Sawyer seems to represent America's long standing bias against ""intellectural"" people. Tom reminded me of all the clever know-it-alls who do their own research during a pandemic. Tom and Huck express America's bias against deductive reasoning and its favorable view of ""common sense"".",4.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"Why I chose to listen to this audiobook: 1. earlier this month, I listened to and wanted to learn more about his friend, Huckleberry Finn; and, 2. February 2024 is my ""Classics"" Month! Praises: 1. Huck's adventures are quite entertaining! From his escape from his abusive Pap to joining forces with Jim, a runaway slave, while they traverse the Mississippi, these events were at times anxiety-ridden, yet other times, hilarious; 2. loved the introduction of various characters which made this story so much fun to follow. Some of my favorites included Huck's visit to Mrs. Judith Loftus while dressed up as a girl, and the shenanigans of those rapscallion frauds, the Duke and the King. I was; however, pleasantly surprised by the arrival of Tom Sawyer himself! His wildly complicated ideas to free Jim, and the actions he and Huck undertook, all the while tempered by Jim's patient demeanor, had me laughing so hard that I had to pause the audiobook from time to time; 3. Huck himself is such a loveable character. He is ""quick on his feet"" as he maneuvers himself (and Jim) out of sticky situations. Most importantly, I appreciated his conscience when it came to Jim's freedom; and, 4. narrator Eric G. Dove does an excellent job with his fluency using various dialects. Overall Thoughts: I cringed with the frequent use of the ""n"" word, but being published in 1884, this story is historically accurate and reflects the times.

"""That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it."" What makes a classic? A question I have had to ask myself repeatedly over the last few days, after students in Grade 8 received the task to come to the library and ""check out a classic to read"". There was a list with the usual suggestions, but students ventured out and started to explore shelves, and then came to me with a wide range of books, repeating the question: ""Is this a classic?"" Why did I turn down the diary of a wimpy kid, they wanted to know, and accept Huckleberry Finn, even though it was so much harder to understand, and also, they had heard it was racist? All good questions, and I was careful not to give a too categorical answer. The last thing I wanted was for them to make the connotation that a classic is a boring must, while a ""good book"" is what the teachers and librarians would refuse. Difficult. I found myself talking about the Count of Monte Cristo and Voldemort, about Tom Sawyer and Oliver Twist in comparison to Harry Potter, and I made a case for trying to get through parts of Huckleberry Finn even though the language is challenging, mainly because it contains exactly the message that people become unfair ""when they don't know nothing about it"". I found myself talking about discovering other times, other societies, other ideas of justice and hierarchy, and I talked about living in the mind of someone other than oneself. Imagine Huckleberry on that raft on the Mississippi, I said. Imagine him being in a conflict between the values he was taught and the humanity he discovered together with his fellow human, who happened to be a black man in distress. Which concept of life would be stronger? Imagine a situation in which you would have to make a choice between what you are taught and what you perceive? ""That's interesting"", a student said. Another one replied: ""Yeah, but it really is racist too!"" And I thought: ""That makes a classic. A book that can still inspire discussions in a school library some 135 years after its initial publication."" So, dear Harry, I hope that in the year 2133, some librarian will tell students that you are a classic hero, still worthy of their attention, even though your worldview may seem a bit dated and out of touch with their perception of reality! And just imagine all the Voldemorts we will have had to fight to make sure there are still school libraries and reading kids by then!

"NOTICE PERSONS attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot. BY ORDER OF THE AUTHOR ... Jim said that bees won't sting idiots, but I didn't believe that, because I tried them lots of times myself and they wouldn't sting me. ... Human beings can be awful cruel to one another. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn opens in the aftermath of , and for a time, it has the same joyous feel as the boys continue their antics of rebellious 12-year-olds. But the return of Huck Finn’s drunk of a father, Pap, hints at the darker, more serious themes of this novel. After being kidnapped and beaten, Huck escapes his father by faking his own death and then going on the run. He soon crosses paths with a runaway slave, Jim, and together they raft their way down the Mississippi. Like its predecessor, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is largely a series of vignettes with a very loose overarching plot. Huck and Jim travel from Missouri through Kentucky and Arkansas and into the antebellum South, getting into scrapes and making escapes along the way. There’s some great humor in their conversations on the raft; their argument about the wisdom of King Solomon is priceless. And there’s classic Twain satire and exposing of hypocrisy here, from the feuding Grangerford and Shepardson families to the con men known as the Duke and the King. So why was I reading this classic novel during Banned Books Week? For that, we have to talk about race and racism. The characters here (and the author, for that matter) are products of their 19th century time. The n-word is used relentlessly in this book, even by the slaves themselves, and it is jarring. Huck says casually racist things here that are heartbreakingly awful; on one occasion, for example, he compliments Jim by thinking “I knowed he was white inside.” And some critics fairly read this book as irredeemably problematic, reinforcing racist stereotypes and repeatedly deriving humor from a variation of a minstrel show. But I come down on the side of those who read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as transcending and challenging the racist stereotypes of the time. Huck has been taught by society all his life to view blacks as slaves, as less than. And at a pivotal moment, he writes a letter to report where Jim can be found by his master, and at first he thinks the letter is the right thing to do: I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ‘stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper. It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: “All right, then, I’ll go to hell”—and tore it up. Huck says the wrong thing, and uses racist language, again and again throughout this book. But he ultimately recognizes and acts on his and Jim’s shared humanity and equality. That might be the best we can realistically expect from a book published in the 1880s. And some days, it’s obvious that our society has not come nearly as far on this score as we’d like to think we have. Is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn the Great American Novel? It’s written by an immortal, epically talented writer. It was one of the first books to truly capture the course, plain spoken language of its time. And by focusing on racism and slavery, it speaks to America’s original sin. So yeah, it just might be, even though I prefer .

"Why have I never read Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn before? Was it Twain’s copious use of the N word? (I vaguely recall a primary school teacher abruptly halting a class read-aloud session, perhaps because of that.) Was it the air of earnest solemnity that surrounds so-called classics? Sheer laziness? No matter. I’ve read it now, and I’ll never be the same again. Hemingway was right when he said (and I’m paraphrasing) all American literature comes from Huck Finn. While it’d be entertaining to read as a kid, it’s even more rewarding to approach as an adult. Savour that wonderful opening paragraph (and tell me you can't hear Holden Caulfield in the cadences): You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly – Tom’s Aunt Polly, she is – and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before. Everything to come is in those opening lines, penned in that distinct, nearly illiterate yet crudely poetic voice. You get a sense of Huck’s humility (compared to Tom Sawyer’s braggadocio); his intelligence; a cute postmodern nod to the author; the idea that storytelling contains “stretchers” but can also tell “the truth”; and the fact that everyone lies, including Huck. Especially Huck. He gets into so many tight spots that part of the joy is wondering how he’ll get out of them. The outlines of the plot should be familiar: Huck, a scrappy, barely literate boy, flees his abusive, alcoholic father by faking his death and travelling the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers with Jim, an escaped slave, on a raft. Huck's gradual awakening to Jim's plight is subtle and touching, never sentimental. In a sense the book chronicles his growing conscience. And the colourful characters he and Jim meet and the adventures they have add up to a fascinating, at times disturbing look at a conflicted, pre-Civil War nation. We meet a Hatfields vs. McCoys type situation; a group of rapscallions who put on a vaudeville-style act and try to fleece rubes; a scene of desperation and danger on a collapsed boat. We witness greed, anger and most of the other deadly sins – all from a little raft on the Mississipi. And before the midway point, we see the toll that a cruel joke can have on someone’s feelings. To a contemporary reader, some of the humour can feel a little forced, and the gags do get repetitive, particularly when Huck’s savvier, better-read friend Tom enters the scene. And then comes a passage like this: When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sun-shiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits whispering – spirits that's been dead ever so many years – and you always think they're talking about YOU. Wow. You can see, hear and feel what he's describing. Hard to believe this was written more than 150 years ago. In the book's closing pages, Huck tells us this: If I’d a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn’t a tackled it, and ain’t a-going to no more. Well, gosh, Huck, it war worth all yer trouble. We’re darn glad you dunnit. Yessir.",5.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652

"I had to read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in middle school, and I fervently wish that they had made us read Huck Finn instead. I mean, I understand why they didn't (giving middle schoolers an excuse to throw around racial slurs in a classroom setting is just asking for a lawsuit from somebody's parents), but Huck Finn is better. It's smarter, it's funnier, and Huck's adventures stay with you a lot longer than Tom's, because Huck's experiences were richer and more interesting, whereas The Adventures of Tom Sawyer could easily have been titled The Adventures of an Entitled Little Asshole . If Tom had to go through half of what happens to Huck in this story, he'd be balled up in the corner crying after five minutes. The action of Huck Finn is set in motion when Huck's father shows up and decides that he's going to be responsible for his son now (the story picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off, with Huck and Tom becoming rich, hence Finn Sr.'s sudden involvement in his kid's life). Huck's father essentially kidnaps him, taking him to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and getting drunk and beating his son. Huck escapes by faking his own death (and it's awesome ) and begins traveling up the Mississippi river. He runs into Jim, a slave who belonged to the Widow Douglas's sister. Jim overheard his owner talking about selling him, so he decided to run away and try to go north. Huck, after some hesitation, goes with him. From this point, the structure of the book closely mirrors Don Quixote : a mismatched pair of companions travels the country, having unrelated adventures and comic intervals. On their travels, Huck and Jim encounter con men, criminals, slave traders, and (in the best mini-story in the book) a family involved in a Hatfields-and-McCoys-like feud with a neighboring clan. The story comes full circle when Tom Sawyer shows up and joins Jim and Huck for the last of their adventures, and the best part of this is that Tom Sawyer's overall ridiculousness becomes obvious once we see him through Huck's eyes. Huck is a great narrator, and I think one of the reasons I liked this book more than its counterpart was because it's narrated in first person, and so Huck's voice is able to come through clearly in every word. In addition to the great stories, there are also some really beautiful descriptions of the Mississippi river, as seen in this passage about the sun rising on the river: ""The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line - that was the woods on t'other side - you couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness, spreading around; then the river softened up, away off, and warn't black any more, but grey; you could see little dark spots drifting along, ever so far away - trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks - rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking, or jumbled up voices; it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log cabin on the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of the river, being a wood-yard, likely, and pulled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh, and sweet to smell, on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!"" (also that was one single sentence. Damn, Mark Twain.) A fun, deceptively light series of stories that's funny and sad when you least expect it. Well done, The List - you picked a good one, for once. ...why are you still here? The review's over. Oh, I get it. You want me to talk about the racism, right? You want me to discuss how Huck views Jim as stolen property instead of a person and criticize the frequent use of the N-Word and say ""problematic"" a lot, right? Well, tough titties. I'm not getting involved in that, because it's stupid and pointless, and I'm just going to let Mark Twain's introduction to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn speak for itself, and the work as a whole: ""Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.""",4.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"-احدى امتع القصص التي قرأتها ابدا. تصلح لكل الأعمار، فكلما نضج القارئ نضجت الرواية معه واستقى معان جديدة منها. - القصة على لسان صبي مراهق؛ تنطلق ببطئ في الفصول الأولى لكن سحرها يبدأ في الكوخ المنعزل مع الفكرة المجنونة للفتى، وتنطلق الرحلة الساحرة. -الشخصيات كانت ممتازة، ف ""هاكلبري"" مغامر ذكي وفطن وطيب، ""جيم"" العبد وقصة تلاقيهما والصفات المعطاة له من ""توين"" كانت مذهلة، ""الدوق""و ""الملك"" من افضل الشخصيات التي وجدتها في رواية يوماً لما يمتلكاه من اساليب شيطانية. - لم يطل توين الأحداث، لكنه جعلها متواترة بطريقة لا تشعرك بالملل وتجعلك تعيش في القصة منتظراً ما الذي سيحصل تالياً، والتنويع الحاصل بين اصناف المغامرات ومواقعها (غابة، نهر، قرية، سيرك، مزرعة...) اتى ليعزز التشويق في هذه الرواية. -الأسلوب سلس على عادة ""مارك توين""، ساخر ومبطن في العديد من الأماكن ومن هنا فمهما كان عمر القارئ سيستقي معنى جديد مبطن بين سطور الرواية. - ""هاكلبري"" ليس بطلاً امريكيا كما اعتادت هوليوود تصويره، فهو ليس مع اعطاء الحرية للعبيد، لكنه طيب القلب وكان جميلاً ان نرى وجهة النظر هذه من دون المزايدات المتعارف عليها!! - ""توين"" يقوم بالسخرية من ""سوير""في نهاية الرواية، ويصوره ككائن جليدي لا يهتم سوى بأفكاره دون اخذ ادنى اعتبار لمشاعر الآخرين. - الترجمة ممتازة وسلسة، واللغة المستعملة بسيطة. - أنصح الجميع بقرأتها لأنها ستضحككم من الصميم في العديد من الأماكن (خصوصا مع ""الملك""و""الدوق"")، وستقرأون فيها العديد من اللمسات الإنسانية، العاطفية وبعض الحبكات المشوقة جداً.",4.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"One of my absolute favourite books, which I have read multiple times. A major classic. If at all possible, get an edition with the original illustrations. ___________________________________ (Expanded review based on conversation with ) Here in Switzerland, l'affaire du mot N hasn't quite had the high profile it's received on its home territory. In fact, I'm embarrassed to admit that I hadn't even heard of it until Jordan gave me a few pointers earlier today. So, no doubt all this has been said before, but I still can't resist the temptation to add my two centimes worth. In case you're as ignorant as I was about hot topics in the literary world, the furore concerns an edition of Huckleberry Finn in which the word 'nigger' has been systematically replaced with 'slave'. My initial response was plain surprise. One of the aspects of the book I enjoy most is Twain's appallingly exact ear for dialogue. He's reproducing the language actually used in the American South of the 1840s, and this, above all, is what gives the novel its force; so why on earth would anyone want to change it? For example, here's Huck's Paw in full flow: ""Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the wust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me -- I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold? -- that's what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now -- that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger. I'm sorry, but I'm honestly unable to see how anyone could think the above passage was racist or might be improved by substituting 'slave' for 'nigger'. It's incidents like this which create the popular European myth that Americans don't understand the concept of irony. If you're curious to know more about the tradition of improving great works of literature by removing dubious words, you might want to take a quick look at which Jordan and I were giggling over. Bowdler, it turns out, had acted from the best of motives. When he was young, his father had entertained him by reading aloud from Shakespeare; but Later, Bowdler realised his father had been extemporaneously omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children. Bowdler felt it would be worthwhile to present an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not a sufficiently ""circumspect and judicious reader"" to accomplish this expurgation himself. He undertook to create a suitably amended version. Or, to be exact, he got his sister to do it and then gave out the books under his own name. Again, his reasons were unimpeachable: it would have reflected badly on her to admit that she had understood the naughtier passages. I won't criticise Dr Bowdler or his equally well-meaning modern followers. I just think it's a shame Mark Twain never had the opportunity to write a story about them.",5.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652

"THE Greatest American Novel? Well... No wonder the Spanish think themselves intellectually/culturally superior with their Quixote, undoubtedly a blueprint for this mischievous Every Boy! Huck Finn is the full embodiment of THE American Fantasy: mainly that dire misconception that the protagonist of the world is you and that everything gravitates around that essential nucleus. Everyone in town thinks Huck dead, and what does he do but follow the tradition of a plot folding unto itself (as Don Q finds his story become medieval pop culture in Part II of that superior novel) as he disguises himself as a little girl and tries to squeeze information out of some lady about his myth-in-the-making trek. It seems everyone cares for this vagrant, a perpetual Sancho P to Tom Sawyer's Quixote, whose redeemable features include (a pre-transcendental) openmindedness and an inclination to live only in the NOW. But the narrator, a very unreliable one at that, surrounds himself with bad bad men, playing the role of accomplice often, always safe and sound under the dragon's wing. Very American in his lemming mentality & in his misconceptions (though about his hometown and wilderness he knows much indeed). So: disguise used as an integral plot device several times throughout; brawny men taking a boy hostage; nakedness by the riverbed; costume changes, improvised Shakespearean shows, men almost always described as ""beautiful"" (and women solely as ""lovely"").... ***GAY!!*** Yeah, it really is hard to discern the allegory behind all of this hype. The humor is obvious, but I have to admit that this picaresque novel about a boy who avoids ""sivilization"" at all costs is beaten mercilessly by a more modern, therefore more RELEVANT tale of the South, ""Confederacy of Dunces."" Although it must be admitted that ""Huck Finn"" does manage to surpass other often-praised classics, like the droll ""Wuthering Heights.""",4.0,positive,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"Pretty good, kinda silly - but I think that is what Twain was going for - 3.5 stars. Twain is the king of the Yarn. Huckleberry Finn is a collection of outlandish tales all with lies and trickery at their heart. At the time of its release I am sure it became a bible for scoundrels and mischevious teens. This book is controversial, and even frequently banned, because of its portrayal of black slaves and the use of the N-word. I venture into shaky ground here by offering my opinion as I am white, but I don't think I will cause too much trouble. I can accept that at the time of writing the words and language were fairly normal so as a time period piece it is true. However, I can't say I have read a book that takes place in that time period that so flippantly tosses the n-word around. Regarding banning of this book - I can definitely tell why some parents might be concerned about their kids reading this book. I think a lot of it depends on how it is being taught - I would hope the teacher would put an emphasis on explaining the language being used. Summary: - A good book - Kind of silly - A handbook for deception - An understandably controversial reflection of the prejudices at the time it was written - Some may need guidance regarding the the way racial differences are portrayed in this book.",3.0,neutral,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
ماجراهای هاکلبری فین نوشته مارک تواین گرچه به ظاهر یک داستان ماجراجویانه‌ است اما در آن موضوعاتی مانند نژادپرستی و برده‌داری از دید یک نوجوان در جنوب آمریکا اواخر قرن نوزده را می توان دید . نویسنده داستان را از نگاه یک نوجوان سرکش و بی‌خانمان روایت کرده که هنوز صداقت کودکانه ، صداقتی که هنوز آلوده نشده را دارد . هم چنین تواین با استفاده از زبان محاوره‌ای و روایت اول‌شخص، جامعه‌ای را نشان داده که در آن قانون و اخلاق، گویی در تضاد با یکدیگر قرار گرفته اند . رمان ماجراهای هاکلبری فین در جنوب آمریکا ، مرکز برده‌داری و نژادپرستی اتفاق می‌افتد ، در امتداد رودخانهٔ می‌سی‌سی‌پی، که یکی از نمادهای جغرافیایی و فرهنگی جنوب آمریکاست . نقطه عطف داستان را باید از جایی دانست که سفر هکلبری فین با برده ای فراری به نام جیم شروع می شود ، هکلبری که اطلاعی از نژاد پرستی و برده داری ندارد و این مفاهیم در ذات او و هر جنوبی دیگر نهادینه شده ، به جیم کمک می کند تا با سفر بر روی می سی سی پی و رسیدن به ایالات شمالی ، هم خود آزاد شود و هم بتواند برای آزادی خانواده اسیرش کاری کند . شاید این سفر هکلبری به سمت شمال را به توان گریزی از جامعه جنوب دانست که جامعه‌ای به ظاهر اخلاق‌مدار اما به شدت تبعیض گذار است . بنابراین ، این سفر شاید هم نماد فرار از ساختارهای فاسد جنوب باشد و هم بستری برای تحول اخلاقی. آیا هک متحول می شود ؟ هاک در آغاز داستان، فردی بی‌تفاوت و ناآگاه نسبت به مسائل اخلاقی و اجتماعی پیرامون خود است. او جیم را صرفاً همراهی در مسیر فرار می داند و همچنان تحت تأثیر باورهای نژادپرستانهٔ رایج جامعهٔ زمان خود قرار دارد. با این حال، در طول سفر، و به‌ویژه در مواجهه با خطرات و چالش ها ، نگرش او به‌تدریج دگرگون می‌شود. نقطهٔ اوج این تحول را باید زمانی‌دانست که هاک تصمیم می‌گیرد برخلاف آموزه‌های رسمی و قوانین موجود، به جیم کمک کند ، گرچه کمک او به‌زعم جامعه غیرقانونی است. تحول هکلبری فین ، گرچه از نظر ظاهری محدود و تدریجی‌ست، اما از نظر معنایی شاید عمیق و تأثیرگذار باشد. هاک، با وجود سن کم و نداشتن سواد ، به درکی انسانی و اخلاقی از آزادی، عدالت، و همدلی می رسد که بیشتر جنوبی ها به آن نرسیده اند . در پایان، ماجراهای هاکلبری فین تنها یک داستان ماجراجویانهٔ نوجوانانه نیست بلکه کتابی است که با صداقت و جسارت، وجدان فرد را در برابر ساختارهای تبعیض آمیز قرار می‌دهد. مارک تواین با استفاده از زبانی ساده و نگاه کودکانه، تاریخ پرتنش آمریکا در قرن نوزدهم را به تصویر کشیده .,3.0,neutral,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,40375652
"""All right, then, I'll GO to hell"" -- This is Huck's decision, rather than turn in his friend, Jim. They had been through many things together. Here's the story.... Huck faked his death and ran away from his drunken father. On Jackson’s Island, in the middle of the Mississippi River, Huck encounters Jim, a runaway slave and his friend. Jim fled because he overheard his owner, Miss Watson, planning to sell him to a plantation. Huck and Jim ultimately must escape the island because their campfire is spotted. Later in their adventures Huck reports... I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote: ‘Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.’ I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper. It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: ""All right, then, I'll GO to hell"" -- and tore it up.’ Huck's epiphany is that Jim is a human being, no matter what people call him or how they treat him, and Huck is willing to risk his soul to help him. =========== I don't listen to many audiobooks, but if you like them may I suggest the brilliantly narrated version by Elijah Wood.
