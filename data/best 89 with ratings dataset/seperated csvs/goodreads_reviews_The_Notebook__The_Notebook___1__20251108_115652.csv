"I love the movie, but if you think that was sappy, do not pick up this book. I heard Nicholas Sparks had a knack for sap, but I almost drowned in it and felt no spark at all. The book was so frustratingly simple and obvious and laid out. The dialoque droned. I'll come back and add a real quote, but it was something like this: ""Do you want to stay for dinner?"" he asked, wondering what she would say. ""Okay,"" she said, and than asked, ""What should we eat?"" ""Crabs,"" he said. She never had crabs. They began to cook the crabs... etc. There is a ""quiver in his loins"" when he sees her in her transparent white dress as well. Oh and ""the two become one"" when they make love. And then she is forced to leave when her fiance pays a surprise visit to down and she struggles to drive through her tears, but fights through the blurry vision because she is a strong woman like her mother... lalalalala. Could the book be any more contrived and gimicky? Who rated this above a one? And please enlighten me. Gag, gag, awful writing, what a frustrating bore. He left nothing to the imagination. Unless you like getting dumber by the minute, don't pick this one up.",1.0,negative,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
"I read this book on a train from Italy to somewhere else in Europe after graduating from college. I was unfortunate enough to be forced to buy it because there were no other English Language novels to choose from. I know this is a beloved book, by a beloved author, but if I could give it any sort of negative rating, I would. The ""Gag me with a spoon"" category is almost too kind. My apologies to any one who likes Nicholas Sparks - if you're able to find the genius in his writing, more power to you! When I heard the plot - an old man is reliving his personal history with the love of his life as she suffers from dementia - I had much hope for a touching story. Esh - I was sorely disappointed. My favorite memory is reading the scene between the two young (and I'm assuming attractive) lovers...they are in a boat on a lake, romantic setting, yes? It starts to rain. She's wearing a white dress. ""We have to get you inside where it's warm...better remove those wet clothes, you'll catch a cold..."" Commence eye-rolling now. After reading the book, I passed it on to my now husband, who was also on the train. Keep in mind, there were no other English options! He starts to comment, ""Oh, they're on the lake in a boat...okay, it's raining...oh geeze, why do you girls read this crap?"" And that's what I think about this book...why would anyone read this (unless there were no other choices)?!?",1.0,negative,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
"well, i was promised tears and, unfortunately, my eyes are as dry as the sahara. i will say that i think the story itself has an unbelievable amount of potential - its the execution that leaves much to be desired. i just couldnt believe the connection between noah and allie and i think its because we dont see any of their history. sure, the reader gets the jist of it as noah is sitting on his porch and thinking about the past - but its all dry facts told to the reader, not first hand experience. this novel takes place over a day and a half in the present, 14 years after noah and allie meet/separate. this should have started when noah and allie first met. i want to experience their summer together. i want to see what happens when allie leaves. i want to worry for noah as he goes off to war. and i want to know what they have been doing these past 14 years. everything is just so underdeveloped. i havent seen the film, but i have seen the trailer, and that has more emotion than this entire book put together because it actually tells the story of noah and allie. which is what this book should have done. ↠ 3 stars",3.0,neutral,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131

"This is the worst book I have EVER READ. And the fact that this guy is so popular continues to astound me. I would give it less than zero stars if I could. My sister tricked me into reading this book, and I wish I could gain that time back into my life so I could read a different book. This book teaches you that ANYONE could write a bestseller. Just be sappy and corny and have one big-ass deus ex machina and you're all set for stardom. As you can tell, I don't read shit that I think I won't like.

"Have you ever come across something so undeniably cute that you feel like you may be crushed by the weight of squee that’s about to explode from you chest. Kind of like when you see this? That’s what reading The Notebook was like. The romantic tone of The Notebook was both its greatest asset and biggest downfall. Nobody wants to be crushed by squee anymore than they want to drown in their own tears and The Notebook wants to destroy you. Never doubt that. Whether it’s leaching your bodily liquids out of you until you resemble The Ice Man or boring you to death. Really, those are the only two options you’ve got with this book. Who can stand to see something as cute as that kitten up there all day every day? You need something not so cute to break up the boredom. Similarly, in The Notebook, the long, romantic verses filled with poetry and stunning imagery will ultimately become tiresome the longer you read it. Probably it’s just me. In case you haven’t figured it out, I’m not exactly the most romantic person out there. In my relationship it’s my husband who is the romantic. He’s the one that makes me breakfast in bed every single morning and puts a rose from the garden on my tray. He’s the one that calls me to see how my day’s gone and sends me soppy, romantic messages. If you’re a sentimental, sweet kind of person (two adjectives nobody has ever applied to me) then I’m sure you’d like this book and it would do you justice. For those who like a little more “action” in the literary sack then this book may tend to waffle on and be overly mushy. Now THAT’S more like it!",2.0,negative,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
"4 Stars - Also reviewed at: Sweet and romantic, but I liked the movie much more. In fact, I LOVED the movie and watched it before reading this. In the movie, the characters of Noah and Allie had more intensity and passion. It is one of those rare moments, for me, when the movie was better than the book. There are some great quotes in this book though. These were my favourite: ""I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."" ""We sit silently and watch the world around us. This has taken a lifetime to learn. It seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content. The young, brash and impatient, must always break the silence. It is a waste, for silence is pure. Silence is holy. It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking."" ""The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given to me..."" ""We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."" ""So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday."" ""I love you. I am who I am because of you. You are every reason, every hope, and every dream I've ever had, and no matter what happens to us in the future, everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life. I will always be yours."" COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER: I do not hold the copyright to any of the images used in this review. They are posted to add visuals to the review and for fun.

"Would Allie have loved Noah if he lived in a cramped apartment? When the movie came out, I was a teenager, clueless about love and the ways of the world, I absolutely loved The Notebook. However, now that I just read the book, I am convinced Allie made the wrong choice! Allie talks about how she thinks Noah is swoon-worthy because other people don’t take enough time to enjoy the things that make life worth living. That’s rich coming from Allie. She appears to have no job other than complaining. Noah is gifted his wealth while Lons works long hours as a self-made lawyer. Sparks is brilliant because he essentially took a modern take on The Great Gatsby where Allie doesn’t consider Noah a potential life partner until she discovers his very nice house. This book does resonant in some ways. Allie and Noah are at an inflection point – they aren’t just picking a partner but a lifetime. They have to guess what The Ghost of Christmas Future will be. The prose isn’t my favorite with a very short sentence structures. The part of the book that I enjoyed – and enjoy is probably the wrong word for being a weeping ball of sentimentality – is when Allie and Noah are older, when they have shared a lifetime of love, weathering the ups and downs of life, the joy, disappointments, and triumphs. Probably just ignore this review from an admittedly romantic cynic. 2025 Reading Schedule Jan	A Town Like Alice Feb	Birdsong Mar	Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De Berniere Apr	War and Peace May	The Woman in White Jun	Atonement Jul	The Shadow of the Wind Aug	Jude the Obscure Sep	Ulysses Oct	Vanity Fair Nov	A Fine Balance Dec	Germinal Connect With Me!",3.0,neutral,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131

They are separated when Allie’s family returns home and after writing letters for two years that go unanswered, Noah decides he needs to move on. Fourteen years later, after seeing Noah in the newspaper for building his house, Allie decides to leave her fiancé at home while she goes to visit Noah in secret. When Noah and Allie meet again, sparks fly and the romance and passion they shared is still there but how can Allie choose one man over the other without someone getting hurt? The story is told by an old man living in a nursing home with his wife. She has dementia and he reads her the story of Noah and Allie. How they met and fell in love, what happens after Allie leaves and the lives they go on to have in the future. I can't believe this is the first time I'm reading the book lol. I've been a really long time fan of the movie- this is one of those stories that has been with me and comforted me in some pretty terrible times, and some really wonderful ones. This is such a love letter, in the purest rawest form. The way that these two love each other and are connected is so freaking beautiful I can't help but get all choked up. It really makes you believe that true love never dies, that it endures and it survives. It's so tender and steadfast- yet also passionate and fiery when they were younger. It's one of my all time favorite love stories. The Notebook is ultimately an epic love story, where the underlying and most lasting message is that true love never dies. I highly recommended you to both read and watch this enchanting love story and get lost in the competing worlds of both language and imagery. Both are sure to impress. “𝒮𝑜 𝒾𝓉'𝓈 𝓃𝑜𝓉 𝑔𝑜𝓃𝓃𝒶 𝒷𝑒 𝑒𝒶𝓈𝓎.

"No need for the tissue box here! 🤷‍♀️ My eyes welled a few times, I admit, but this book didn’t turn on the waterworks for me. So callous, I know… If I had to pick this book’s biggest fault it would be its length. Although beefy reads can be intimidating to start, the payout is worth it if it holds a great story. This could have been that had it been longer than about 200 pages. The story could have easily been 400. A lot of things were glossed over and initial chemistry was skipped altogether and that’s where I feel a romance can truly shine. As is expected when reading a Nicholas Sparks book, the cheese is at a 10 at all times. Some lines really made me blush. “He felt his loins begin to stir” If I enjoy anything about loins being stirred we better be talking about pork loins! This was a minor nuisance as it fit that category of ‘lust story’ not ‘love story’. We are told alllll about Allie’s amazing fiancé, Lon. He’s handsome, rich, kind and romantic and she loves him. His biggest flaws are his demanding job and reluctance to talk about his emotions. Shortly after leaning this we have this paragraph in regards to Noah: “He exuded sexuality in everything he did, everything he was, and she caught herself thinking of him in a way that an engaged woman shouldn’t. She tried not to stare and glanced away often, but the easy way he moved his body made it hard for her to keep her eyes from him for long.” You’re considering throwing away a relationship you built for years that has minimal downsides for the hot guy you had a fling with a summer 14 years prior and haven’t seen since? That didn’t seem very likely and I had to suspend belief for a moment there. I would like to add that my thoughts may be biased as I have seen the movie half a dozen times and I enjoy it. In my personal and honest opinion, the movie did it better especially in regards to the ending. I didn’t dislike this ending however, I enjoyed the movie’s version more.",3.0,neutral,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
"✩ 4 stars ✩ What to Expect: ➼ First Love ➼ Forbidden Love ➼ Second Chance ➼ Different World’s ➼ Enduring Love ➼ First Person POV As I’ve been organizing my thoughts on this book, the thing I keep coming back to is how closely the movie followed the plot of the book. Perhaps this was possible because of the book’s relatively short length, but it could very nearly have doubled for a script. The question I’ve been asking myself with each Nicholas Sparks book I’ve read is, which is better, the movie or the book? You might think it would be a hard call to make this time because of their similarities, but in this particular case, the movie was the very clear winner for me. It’s a great story either way, but the movie is just so beautifully made and well cast. The plots are nearly identical, but the characters didn’t inspire the same level of emotion while reading as they did when I watched the film. I also think Sparks uses some strange verbiage at times which earned him a few lip curls from me. Sometimes it almost felt like I was reading a regency novel or something when he mentions character’s bosoms or loins stirring or describes a character as “aroused sexually.” Isn’t “sexually”already implied? 😅 The wording just feels kind of clinical and on the nose at times in my opinion. At the end of the day, I’m still really glad I read this even if it was slightly upstaged by the film. Sparks definitely gave the directors a lot of great material to work with! I count this as a classic and think it’s still a must read book for any who are interested. ✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼　 ҉ 　✼ Pre-read: Every time I complete a “last, now, next” template, it pretty much guarantees I won’t want to read the book I’ve said I’m reading next. 😅 That being said, I’m starting this, but don’t be alarmed if I start another book in like an hour because I’m really not in the mood. 🫠",4.0,positive,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
"I read this book because my sister loved it. It made me sad. Not because it was a sad story, but because it was so poorly written. This Sparks character had a fantastic idea for a story, a truly painful and passionate story of love and devotion. But the book? It was like my 14 year old nephew watched this brilliant movie, then tried to write about it on his myspace blog. It was butchered by an appalling lack adjectives and an appalling lack of emotion. Sad. The fact that so many people are willing to overlook Sparks' lack of creativity and inability to, well, write, is also sad. Sad, I say.

For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it.” ---- This book is the reason why I’m an hopeless romantic and I was never more proud to be one. Considering the fact that I love the movie and cried like a baby while watching it, I should’ve been prepared for this book. In fact, I knew I would love the story the second I thrifted the book. But still, I was not prepared for the last 60 pages. at. all. In the beginning we follow Noah Calhoun and Allison Nelson in the 1940s in North Carolina. One summer they meet – and obviously - this summer is becoming a dream for both of them. But in the end they still live in different social strata and have to figure out what they want their life to look like. Yes, this story is no new invention, but that’s good, because it was never the aim of the book to create something new. “I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough..” The notebook is about love, but not about the basic love you find in other books, it’s about real, deep and indestructible love. The love with which Noah loved Allie and Allie loved Noah. Written in the most incredible heart-warming and heart-breaking way, we follow their relationship, through good times, bad times, sickness and health. Noah and Allie cherish each other so much. Reading about their love and also reading about how hard it actually is to love someone, was just incredible. All the things you endure for the other. I’m still tearing up now, because in my mind I’m still in the last 60 pages of the book. I want to find this love in my life, I want to have a Noah, who talks about me the way he did about Allie. I won’t spoil too much of the book, because I’m selfish and want you all to read it. And please do actually read it, I swear you won’t regret it.

***** 4.5 STARS ***** I first read this book when I was about 15 so this was almost not memorable for me though I’ve watched the movie thousands of times. (Even in the middle of reading this book this time around just because I wanted to double up being all in my feels.) This book is just.... beautiful. The way Allie and Noah’s love for each other just spills out of the pages is just magical. I feel just so grateful to be able to read their story. Letter writing really knows how to tear at my heart strings. I’m a big letter writer and just think it’s such a wonderful way to articulate the way you feel so to read about it... ugh. My heart. The letter Allie writes Noah made me sob. My girlfriend looks over and here I am at 8pm crying on the couch into these pages that I never wanted to end. Wonderful book. I am so glad that I read this again and I know I will a lot more in the future!!,5.0,positive,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
"EXCERPT: His best friend these days was Gus, a seventy year old black man who lived down the road. They had met a couple of weeks after Noah had bought the house, when Gus had shown up with some homemade liquor and Brunswick stew, and the two had spent their first evening together getting drunk and telling stories. Now Gus would show up a couple of nights a week, usually around eight. With four kids and eleven grandchildren in the house, he needed to get out of the house now and then, and Noah couldn't blame him. Usually Gus would bring his harmonica, and after talking for a little while, they'd play a few songs together. Sometimes they played for hours. He'd come to regard Gus as family. There really wasn't anyone else, at least not since his father died last year. He was an only child; his mother had died of influenza when he was two, and though he had wanted to at one time, he had never married. But he had been in love once, that he knew. Once and only once, and a long time ago. And it had changed him forever. Perfect love did that to a person, and this had been perfect. ABOUT THIS BOOK: Set amid the austere beauty of the North Carolina coast begins the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner recently returned from the Second World War. Noah is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. MY THOUGHTS: I had just written this review, hit enter . . . and it disappeared - 'Poof!' So here we go again . . . Although I am not particularly fond of the story, The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks holds a very special place in my heart. This was the very first book that my now husband ever gave me. I like to take it out every now and then and reread it, not because of the story, but because of the precious memories it inspires. Books can do that. Bring back wonderful memories. If I was rating The Notebook on that alone, it would earn 5 stars plus from me. But as for the actual story, it earns a little over three stars. It is a bit too sweet for my taste, but perfect for those times when you want a read that you can enjoy without having to think too much. BTW, this is not the book he would choose for me now. He is the romantic in this relationship. He cries every time he watches 'Titanic'. I have yet to sit through it. ***.2 THE AUTHOR: Sparks lives in North Carolina. He contributes to a variety of local and national charities, and is a major contributor to the Creative Writing Program (MFA) at the University of Notre Dame, where he provides scholarships, internships, and a fellowship annually.

"Besides the awful writing style (just to mention unimaginative, spiritless and full of clichés), I found the story just a little too contrived and far too predictable. I couldn't get over the premise where Noah and Allie meet when they are teenagers, spend one summer together and meet again after 14 years to realise they are still utterly in love?! What?! It irritated me to no end that Sparks felt the need to not leave anything unexplained, describing things in excruciating detail, boring me but more so putting me off reading any of his other books. In the end it just felt like it was dragging on and on and on - I just wanted it to end. Also, since I listened to the audio version I must say that the choice for the reader of the audio book isn't the most brilliant one. His voice is kind of suited for the old Noah but his imitation of a young Allie is just really off-putting. Plus, he's got that kind of voice that makes me want to fall asleep straight away. Combine that with the terrible style and plot, this book can only be described as indigestible. No more Nicholas Sparks for me, thank you!",1.0,negative,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131

"So, I didn't love this book, even though every other girl on planet earth does. Here's the deal: it's an old guy at the end of his life, showing how undyingly committed and in love he is with his elderly wife, who is dying of Alzheimer's. Sweet, right? Except here is how he shows his love: every day, he reads her the story of their love. It involves hooking up as teenagers, then being apart without communication for years and years, yet yearning for one another while sleeping around with other people, then getting back together to fornicate like crazy and cheat on her fiance and break up her soon to be wedding. If that is not eternal and undying love, I don't know what is. There is no way you can go wrong picking a life partner if you are horny and running away from responsibility and commitment, as this book clearly shows. That is the only way to find a man who will love you and change your diapers for you when you get old. Okay, so he wasn't changing her diapers, but you get the point. I try to go with the romance of the book, and it is romantic in the eldery love sort of way (hence the 3 stars, because I figure eventually they grew up), but I can't help but think the main characters are sleazy.

Guardaba un recuerdo precioso de la historia hasta que un buen amigo me dijo que la peli tiene una escena (cuando Noah se cuelga de la noria y amenaza a Allie con tirarse si no le da una cita) que es la antítesis del romanticismo. Noah manipula a Allie coaccionándola y eso no es romántico... eso es algo muy tóxico. A raíz de la conversación con mi amigo me surgió la duda de si Nicholas Sparks también escribió la misma escena o no. He leído El cuaderno de Noah y no hay noria ni nada similar. La novela es cortita, el amor entre los protagonistas es indestructible y me volvió a ocurrir que la parte en la que ambos son ancianos me pareció mucho más conmovedora y emotiva que cuando ambos están en la flor de la vida. Amor sempiterno ❤.",4.0,positive,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
"Does such true love really exist? Nicholas Sparks, all I can tell is that your wife Cathy has been lucky to marry you!I cried like a baby.Yes, true love will return to you, maybe not in a very perfect condition, maybe with a fiancee, maybe not with a good heart, but surely it'll return.",5.0,positive,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",33648131
