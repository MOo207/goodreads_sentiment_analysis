"Book Review 4+ of 5 stars to , a collection of poetry published in 1974 by . What a wonderful book to read with children at any age; that is, both any age for the reader and the children! I first read this book when I was about 10-years-old, and then again in college. From the brilliant characters to the alliteration and rhyme, to the memorable lines and funny situations, it's one of those books where you will find something new each time you read it. I cannot imagine being this creative. I can dream up stories about real people and situations and have written several, but to have an imagination where animals and things can talk, have emotions, interact in peculiar ways... to find the words to compare and contrast... to describe and draw precious creations... is true talent. I admire Silverstein's massive fantasy world of freedom. He was so unconstrained in his ability to develop a world with just enough charm and beauty to win us all over. It's a book all about perception, but without taking the didactic and pedantic approach. Children see things differently than adults. Adults have limits. Children have experiences. But what happens on the other side... where something is too far to see, or too close to imagine? Who lives in the crack between cement blocks? The world of freedom does... and that's where Silverstein wants us to go, where we are all equal, without preconceived notions... to be able to explore as if we are seeing something for the first time... and connecting with everyone around us. That's how to motivate readers with this book... children learning to see more than what they actually see. I could go on and on... but I'll stop. It's just a wonderful way to learn.

"This is a book that has been on our family shelves literally for generations. My own offspring enjoyed it, and are now sharing it with their children. There is a great pleasure in hearing someone say, ""I remember when you read this to me."" I've always enjoyed Silverstein's humor. There is such a wide variety of poems in here, long and short, some that depend on his illustration and some that stand alone. I think poetry is important for kids. There is a rhythm to our English language, and I think poetry has always captured it better than prose. So many of the poems here are complete little stories. And I enjoy that they break the staid and starchy reputation that is so often unjustly attached to poetry. This is one of those books that can be opened to any page, any time. And it's definitely a book that begs to be shared and read aloud.",5.0,positive,Where the Sidewalk Ends,30119
"There's a polar bear - in the fridgedare - he likes it cuz its cold in there! I wrote a report on this in the 6th grade and I still remember that by heart. That was the year I got braces and Chris N. butted in line when we were coming in from recess and I grabbed his arm and said ""No Butting!"" and he turned around and punched me in the face. The braces smashed into my lip and it bled so bad! I went to the bathroom with a girlfriend (I can't remember her anymore - isn't that strange?) and she tried to help me clean up and then the bell rang and she went back to class and I had to walk in to class with my bloody face. My teacher looked at me - and I was trying to skulk so quietly in - and he said ""Who did that to you?!?!?"" and I said Chris N. and he grabbed him by the shirt and lifted him off the ground and slammed him into the wall. He said something like ""You don't hit girls!"" and took him to the principles office. The funny thing?!?! That weekend I got chicken pox (the second time!) and when I got back they gave me two weeks detention for getting in a fight. (I am so not shitting you.) And when I went to detention - they made me sit in the hall by myself rather than sitting in detention with all the assholes who got busted for real shit. Man I have had the most fucked up life. Huh?

"Every child eventually discovers the perverted old man who wrote songs for Johnny Cash, did illustrations for Playboy, appeared on the Dr. Demento show numerous times, and managed to get a few books published along the way. For some reason, parents never seem to think this creepy old guy who was so fond of children was in any way ""disturbing,"" something I'm continually impressed with in the ""ban now, ask questions later"" climate of modern culture. If there are people who don't like Shel Silverstein, I don't want to meet them. Or, more to the point, you shouldn't meet them if that is an option. Children need to experience this kind of creepy / weird / funny / sad stuff, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of having a conduit through which they can make sense of most of the rest of the world. Knowing that Shel sees things this way, too, makes it all easier to take, and makes your own oddness that much more tolerable. We, as humans, need to come to terms with inexplicable and unfathomable in the world, and it wasn't until Shel that we began to realize that the only way to gently help our children do just that, is to let a perverted old weirdo with a large stack of Playboys in his basement lead the way.",5.0,positive,Where the Sidewalk Ends,30119

"I am crap at reciting from books. Sure, I know your super-famous opening lines and popular misquotations, but I don't really, like, pause in my reading to note a particularly nice turn of phrase so I can commit it to memory. Which is odd, because I have always had a pretty good memory for the spoken word and, especially, lyrics. When I was little, my parents found this most amusing. They would hear me playing in my bedroom, singing random snatches of commercial jingles and songs from A Prairie Home Companion to myself. Then they would try to make me perform them for guests. ""Sing the song from the Garrison Keillor tape!"" they would say. ""No,"" I would respond, suddenly shy. ""Come on, sing it!"" they'd smile. (""He's being shy, he usually sings this all day!"") ""No, I don't want to,"" I'd insist. ""Come on, Joel, sing the song from the tape ."" ""NOOOOO!"" I would shout, now in tears. ""SING IT OR YOU'RE IN TROUBLE!"" One of the things they would force me to perform like a trained monkey I liked to recite best was Shel Silverstein poetry. I had a cassette tape of Where the Sidewalk Ends (read by the author) that I listened to over and over, to the point where I had all the timing and inflections down and everything. I still have them memorized. The Crocodile's Toothache Oh, the crocodile went to the dentist and he sat down into the chair. And the dentist said, [jovially] ""Now tell me sir, why does it hurt and where?"" And the crocodile said, ""I'll tell you the truth, I've a terrible terrible ache in my tooth!"" And he opened his jaws so wide, so wide, the dentist he climbed right inside! And the dentist laughed, [gleefully] ""Oh, isn't this fun?"" as he pulled the teeth out one by one. And the crocodile cried, [frantic] ""You're hurting me so! Please put down your pliers and let me go!"" But the dentist just laughed with a [deep voice] ""Ho ho ho!"" and said, ""I still have 12 to go! Oops, that's the wrong one, I confess but what's one crocodile tooth more or less?"" And then suddenly the jaws went snap! [pause] And the dentist was gone, right off the map. From north, [pause] to south, [pause] to east, [pause] to west, [pause] he left no for- ward- ing address. But [long pause] what's one dentist, more or less? FROM MEMORY! It is better if you can hear it.

"من به یک سری از دلایل، انگیزه های زیادی ندارم برای اینکه بچه ای از خون و ریشه های خودم داشته باشم. بچه ها رو دوست دارم، حتی تربیت کردن بچه هم مشکلی نیست، مشکل از همون پله اول سرچشمه می گیره، اینکه 50 درصد از مسئولیت اومدن یه انسان جدید به این جهان رو بر عهده بگیری و به این نتیجه برسی که قادر به این خواهی بود که این جهان رو اونقدر خوب برای بچه ـت رقم بزنی که اومدنش بهتر از نیومدنش باشه اما از وقتی با کتاب های شل سیلوراستاین آشنا شدم، به جرأت می تونم بگم که علاقه خیلی بیشتری به ایده بچه داشتن پیدا کردم. حین خوندن کتاب هاش، این ایده که که ساعت 11 شب، یه بچه 5 ساله رو ببری توی اتاق خوابش، روشنایی اتاقش رو خاموش کنی، شبخواب ـش رو روشن کنی و براش از شعرهای عمو شلبی بخونی تا خوابش ببره رهام نمی کنه. شعرهای سیلوراستاین به بزرگترین انگیزه ـم از بچه داشتن تبدیل شده و این مبالغه نیست به این فکر می کنم که بچه ای که این شعرها رو از همون دوران خردسالی براش خونده باشن و این مضامین توی ضمیرش نقش بسته باشه، چقدر می تونه سطح فکری بالاتری از هم سن و سال هاش داشته باشه و چقدر می تونه در آینده برای ""زمین"" مفید باشه. مضامینی که سیلوراستاین بهشون پرداخته انقدر متنوع و زیادن که حتی از تمام چیزهایی که شما به عنوان والدین قراره به بچه یاد بدید هم بیشتره و کامل تره! و جالب این جاست که بعضی هاشون انقدر عمیق هستن که حتی واسه منِ 21 ساله هم آموزنده هستن. یکی از شعرهایی که حس کردم خودم هم می تونم ازش یاد بگیرم این بود: Just ME, Just Me Sweet Marie, she loves just me (she also loves Maurice McGhee) No she don't, she loves just me (She also loves Louise Dupree) No she don't, she loves just me (She also loves the willow tree) No she don't, she loves just me (Poor, poor fool, why can't you see She can love others and still love thee) من حداقل تا یکی دو سال پیش توی درک و هضم مضمومنی که توی شعر بالا بهش پرداخته شده عاجز بودم و آدمایی رو هم می شناسم که این مشکل رو دارن، بنابراین این نشون میده که شعرهای سیلوراستاین با اینکه در وهله اول برای بچه ها نوشته شدن، ولی مخاطبشون می تونه خیلی خیلی گسترده تر از ""فقط بچه ها"" باشه واقعاً باور دارم که اگه مردم دنیا شعرهای سیلوراستاین رو مثل یه قرارداد نا نوشته از همون بچگی برای بچه هاشون بخونن، مفهوم دنیایی ازصلح و یه حسی مثه نفرت از جنگ و خون ریزی توی ذهن ها بچه ها نقش می بنده و شاید یه دنیای بهتر رو داشته باشیم. این شعر رو بخونید مثلاً: Hug O' War I will not play at tug o' war, I'd rather play at hug o' war, Where everyone hugs Instead of tugs, Where everyone giggles and rolls on the rug, Where everyone kisses, And everyone grins, And everyone cuddles, And everyone wins. و هر شعر هم نقاشی خاص خودش رو داره که برای بچه هایی که سواد خوندن کتاب رو ندارن، جذابیت مضاعف ایجاد می کنه و بن مایه شعر رو می تونن از نقاشی مربوط به شعر درک کنن من خودم جزء اون بچه های خوش شانسی بودم که پدر مادرم و عمه عزیزم توی بچگی برام کتاب داستان می گرفتن و می خوندن و با کتاب بزرگ شدم. با این وجود، کتاب داستان هایی که من خوندم این درجه از غنا رو نداشتن. کتاب داستان های اوایل دهه هفتاد بودن که معمولاً حول محور ""حسن کچل"" می چرخیدن و الان تنها چیزی که ازشون یادم مونده اینه: کچل کچل کلاچه روغن کله پاچه که اینجا شاید نویسنده می خواست این پیام رو بده که نباید کچل ها رو مسخره کرد به خاطر مو نداشتنشون، ولی بر عکس این شعره توی ضمیر ناخودآگاه نقش می بست و هر وقت یه آدم کچل یا بچه ای که موهاش رو زده بودن رو می دیدم، این شعره رو می خوندم! این کتاب رو از یه حراجی پیدا کردم و دلیل اینکه خریدمش هم دو زبانه بودنش (یه طرف متن اصلی، یه طرف متن ترجمه شده) بود. پیشنهادم اینه که هر نوع شعر خارجی رو اگه به زبان اصلی نمی خونید، حتی الامکان به صورت دو زبانه بخونید و فقط به متن فارسی اکتفا نکنید. همه ـمون می دونیم که ترجمه شعر چقدر کار سختیه و چقدر از زیبایی ها و احساسات اصیل شعر در ترجمه از بین میره یا تغییر می کنه. به شخصه قسمت انگلیسی کتاب رو خوندم، ولی ترجمه ها هم خیلی خیلی عالی صورت گرفته بود و حتی یک اشکال ترجمه هم توش پیدا نکردم. نسخه من از نشر ""هوای تازه"" و با ترجمه ""رضی خدادادی"" بود. در پایان، یکی از شعرهای کوتاه و زیبای کتاب رو به عنوان حسن ختام می نویسم: LISTEN TO THE MUSTN'TS Listen to the MUST'NTS, child, Listen to the DON'TS Listen to the SHOULDN'TS The IMPOSSIBLES, the WON'TS Listen to the NEVER HAVES Then listen close to me_ Anything can happen, child, ANYTHING can be",5.0,positive,Where the Sidewalk Ends,30119

"This is officially one of my favorite children's books. I read this with my 10, 9, and 7 year old daughters. We all loved the book so very much, but I was really surprised at just how into it I was...I think the girls got just as big a kick out of watching me laughing maniacally as they got out of the actual book. I realize that I'm way behind on discovering this author, and so I'm just giving a general 'enjoyment' review. Silverstein not only made me laugh so hard I almost cried, but he also write with such heart that he could make me cry with a one page poem. Admittedly, I have a soft heart when it comes to children's books. Some of his clever rhymes reveal the magic of the young and how some kids are able to live in a world all their own...that wonderful place called childhood. And yet it all has an adult spin on it, a sense of longing that only adults can have for the childhood that is long gone for them. Deeper meanings, folks... “Magic Sandra’s seen a leprechaun, Eddie touched a troll, Laurie danced with witches once, Charlie found some goblins gold. Donald heard a mermaid sing, Susy spied an elf, But all the magic I have known I've had to make myself.” There are some that have big morals that spouted long conversations between my kids and I: “My skin is kind of sort of brownish pinkish yellowish white. My eyes are greyish blueish green, but I'm told they look orange in the night. My hair is reddish blondish brown, but its silver when its wet, and all the colors I am inside have not been invented yet.” And some that were just for fun and had us all giggling like crazy loons. We've already gone back and reread some favorites...And I love how the pictures come right from the authors head, as well as the words. His imagination does it much better than ours could have! Highly recommended for any parents and kids who need a dose of imagination, humor, and insight. I'd even recommend this to just an adult who likes to laugh.",5.0,positive,Where the Sidewalk Ends,30119

"“Where the Sidewalk Ends” is another book of poems from the creative mind of Shel Silverstein, who is the popular author of “A Light in the Attic.” This book details poems about silly people and animals doing crazy activities. Even though this book has some suggestive content, children will easily be delighted in this book for many years. Shel Silverstein has done an awesome job with both illustrating and writing this book of poems. Shel Silverstein’s writing is witty and creative as uses bizarre creatures and humans to summarize each poem in a humorous way. The poem that I thought stood out the most was the poem about Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who refused to take the garbage out and meets a grisly end (even though he never mentions what happened to her) and that poem expresses the moral that it is important to take the garbage out when it is needed and how one must listen to their parents when doing chores. Shel Silverstein’s illustrations are hilarious and crude as he illustrates each character with long limbs and exaggerated expressions and I also love the way that Shel Silverstein puts the illustrations in black and white format which is mostly found in chapters books for both children and adults. Parents should know that there is a great deal of suggestive content in this book mainly revolving around the topic of morbid humor and the topic of God. The two poems that might be the most controversial would be “Ma and God” and “Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout would not take the Garbage Out.” In “Ma and God,” the poem talks about how Ma always tells her child to not do bad things, even though God has created the bad things for the child to do. For instance, one passage mentions that mother tells their children to eat their vegetables, but God creates sweets for children to eat. This poem might give children the wrong message about God and parents might want to teach their children about religion before they read them this poem. In “Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout would not take the Garbage out,” the garbage overflows the house and eventually the city when Sarah refused to take the garbage out. This poem might worry small children who think that if the garbage overflows their house, then they will meet a tragic fate too. However, the poem merely tries to teach children to obey their parents and parents should try to comfort their children about this poem and the importance of taking the trash out. “Where the Sidewalk Ends” is another great classic book of poems from Shel Silverstein and it will surely help engage children into the world of poetry. I would recommend this book for children ages six and up due to the suggestive themes of God and some morbid humor that younger children might not understand.

"One of my most favorite authors of my youth, Silverstein does a most excellent job of tapping into the heart of a child. Whether it be a child's heart in an adult or an actual child, the result is the same: pure and simple joy. Silverstein excels not only in rhyming, but his use of adjectives in the English language when describing things such as ""icky, stick, peanut butter sandwiches"" makes this a joy not only to listen to, but to read out loud as well. I remember having it read to me for the first time when I was five years old, and I loved it so much I stole my friend's copy from her house. (Her family had more money and didn't even appreciate them, but I know that's no excuse. When I told my Mom this story, she was like ""Why didn't you tell me? We could have tried to get the books for you!"" I had no answer. A five year olds reasoning, even mine, is sometimes beyond me.) In any case, I absolutely love this book and the other books by Silverstein as well. If you never read anything to your children other than these books, you will at least have instilled a love of poetry in your child. My five year old is now making up poems and reciting them to anyone who will listen. A great addition and absolute must-have for any children's (or adult children's - like me!) library.

I picked up the different titles with care, reminiscing over what age I was when I read that particular book myself, or read it later to kids as a babysitter, or read it to my first child, who is quite a bit older than my little daughters are now. I then realized I've never owned Where the Sidewalk Ends, so we bought a copy and brought it home and added it to our little school here. I'm not only Mom, I'm Teacher, too, and by day 2 of reading his poetry I was reminded of why this became a classic. Silverstein not only found a brilliant way of writing poetry to appeal to children, he was an inventive and imaginative poet for adults as well. He dabbles in just about everything: clever shape poems, no rules free verse, traditional metered rhyme, limericks, haiku, acrostic poems, too.
