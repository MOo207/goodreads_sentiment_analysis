"(A) 86% | Extraordinary Notes: A relationshippy respite, it’s Sturm und Drang defogging: all lovesick woe, observing foes, and problematic snogging. *Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates: - 3% (1) The Muggle Prime Minister would have been John Major. - No wonder he lost the 1997 election in a landslide. - Likely fictional, though, as Major wasn't elected to power, and his predecessor wasn't male. (2) Fudge: ""Is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly."" - Well, horcruxes are forbidden knowledge. - 6% (1) ""A threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp."" - How vampire-chic. - Snape's house could use a woman's touch. (2) ""In her fury [Bellatrix] looked slightly mad."" - I guess she's always in her ""fury"" then. (3) I never hear of wizard divorces... perhaps they make unbreakable vows? - 9% (1) ""Rufus Scrimgeour ... has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm."" - Appointment? By who? There doesn't appear to be any wizarding monarch or anything. (2) J.K. Rowling does love giving animal descriptions to antagonists: Scrimgeour is ""lionlike,"" Petunia has a ""horsey face,"" Vernon has ""piggy eyes,"" etc. - 13% (1) We're introduced to the idea of inferi, which are essentially zombies. The lack of a full-blown zombie chase is one of the series' big missed opportunities. (2) ""The wandlight sparkled on [Slughorn's] shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache ..."" - Again with the animal descriptors. (3) Gwenog Jones must be the Welshest name ever. - 17% Harry and Ginny be like, ""I shouldn't have been so happy about that hug."" (1) Two weeks since last book and Hermione's already at the Burrow when Harry arrives? Poor Hermione's parents. (2) ""Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed."" - Already giving each other married couple signals. (3) Hermione: ""I know I failed everything!"" - 20% (1) Fred to Ginny: ""Moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?"" - Well, one per year's not so fast. Though, compared to the other Weasleys, I suppose. (2) '""Our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,"" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects.' - I presume ""hooter"" means something different in British English. - 23% (1) '""She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,"" Fleur mused.' - Sounds like Fleur's finally cottoned onto Molly and Ginny's cunning plan to get Bill to dump her for Tonks. (2) In the books, Luna's Spectrespecs are a kind of snake oil novelty. In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible. - 26% Ginny be like: ""Get a room you two."" (1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her. (2) Nearly Headless Nick: ""I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust."" Ron: ""That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead."" - Ron again with the common sense. - 29% Finally! Book-accurate bushy hair! (1) Snape: ""We are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter."" Harry: ""Yes."" Snape: ""Yes, sir."" Harry: ""There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor."" - New levels of reckless sass. (2) Harry smells something flowery in the love potion. Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny. - Not exactly subtle. - 33% (1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it. (2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel. (3) Dumbledore: ""The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins."" - Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians. - 36% (1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious. (2) Harry: ""But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?"" - Hermione gets a taste of her own medicine here, seeing as she says this to Ron all the time, albeit less polite. - 39% Callback/Mirroring: You've got something on your face. (1) Harry: ""The Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far."" - Oh the irony. (2) Hermione: ""Ron, what are you staring at?"" Ron: ""Nothing."" Hermione: ""I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky."" - Ron crushing on Madam Rosmerta and Hermione being jealous never gets old. - 42% (1) Wonder if Caractacus Burke was named after the Briton chieftain or the dad from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang? (2) Orphanage matron: ""He was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus."" - Hmm... The Great Marvolo! (3) Young Voldemort owning a harmonica is just plain funny. - 44% (1) Harry: ""What if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it?"" - Depends how much they enjoy bickering... it's kind of their thing. (2) ""What if they didn't split up? What if ... it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?"" - Classic third-wheel talk right there. - 46% (1) Harry: ""Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team."" Ginny: ""Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat."" - Can't fault the logic. (2) Ginny teases Ron for ""never snogg[ing] anyone in his life."" She also tells Ron ""Hermione snogged Viktor Krum."" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess. - 48% Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot. (1) Ron: ""She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong."" - Ron's not wrong, but misses the point. (2) Hermione: ""He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ... I really couldn't care less."" - She sure talks about it a lot for not caring. - 49% (1) '""Are you going out with [Cormac], then?"" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. ""Oh — yes — didn't you know?"" said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.' - I doubt there's even a Hermione-ish giggle. Mostly she blushes. (2) Harry: ""Serves you right for coming with [Cormac]."" Hermione: ""I thought he'd annoy Ron most."" - I expect no less from a jealousy-fueled romance. - 51% (1) ""Harry ... was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency."" - Hopefully those dreams aren't Voldemort's doing. (2) ""Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge."" - 53% Harry and Ginny be like: Not cool bro! (1) Kreacher gifts Harry a box of maggots. Not useful, but it's the thought that counts. (2) '""Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.' - Most romantic maggot scene in fiction? - 56% (1) ""Abstinence"" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly. (2) Harry: ""Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?"" Hermione: ""No, I can't... So don't even ask."" - Can't or won't? (3) ""The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?"" - Eh, only the regrettable ones. - 58% (1) Hermione: ""Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ... After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?"" - It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying ""Won-Won."" Sarcasm, yes, but ""Won-Won"" regardless. (2) ""Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav,' [Harry] would have to put his foot down."" - The buck stops at ""Lav-Lav""! - 60% Poor Lavender :( (1) Hermione: ""Golpalott's Third Law states that the antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components."" - That makes no sense! How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it! (2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :) - 62% (1) ""[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying."" - I vote Lavender. (2) ""Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing."" - Pretty passive ambition there. - 64% (1) Lavender: ""Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?"" Harry: ""Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?"" Lavender: ""Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting."" - Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting. - 68% (1) Lavender to Ron: ""Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?"" - I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends. (2) Voldemort: ""You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore."" Dumbledore: ""Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen."" - That's some stealthy foreshadowing there. - 71% (1) Ron: ""I love you, Hermione."" Hermione: ""Don't let Lavender hear you saying that."" Ron: ""I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me."" - Essentially, that's what happened in the film. (2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense. (3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual. - 73% (1) Ron: ""Quick, hide me!"" Hermione: ""It isn't Lavender!"" - If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse. (2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean. Luckily, that happened as a side effect of his Slughorn mission. So, bonus points. - Incidentally, Harry's low-key a homewrecker. - 75% (1) '""What were you doing up there with her?"" shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories.' - Lavender's suspicions confirmed! - Lucky all around... except Lavender. (2) Slughorn: ""Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert."" - I see what she did there :) - 78% (1) '""You have [uncommon skill and power],"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —"" ""I know!"" said Harry impatiently. ""I can love!"" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, ""Big deal!"".' - I had the same reaction as Harry to the ending of ""The Fifth Element."" ""Really? Love is the greatest power there is?"" - 82% (1) Flitwick: ""A little less talk, a little more action."" - Wasn't that an Elvis song? No, wait, that was ""A Little Less Conversation."" (2) Harry's mind: ""She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!"" - Ron, Ron, Ron. - 85% (1) Ginny: ""All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ... I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail ... Much more macho."" - Harry's already kinda got a lightning bolt tattoo, and on his face too! I'd guess that's be even more macho. (2) ""Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement."" - Fight it! Angst was so Book 5. - 86% (1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron? (2) ""Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise."" - I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up? - 87% (1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood! (2) Dumbldore: ""You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine."" - So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic. - 88% (1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining. (2) '""It's going to be all right, sir,"" Harry said over and over again ... ""Don't worry..."" ""I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.""' - Hits me right in the feels. *character limit",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",1

"""5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius Curse."" Time for interesting little subplots is over. We've arrived finally, where everything is closely tied to the core of the story and progressing fast. It's always delightful to see, everything that was great about the series still remains the same, if not better. However, disappointments, sorrow and hardships are what the reader is going to encounter for the most part. As I finished reading Half-Blood Prince, more than ever before, I feel being trapped in a hopeless situation filled with nothing but forebodings. ""Destination...determination...deliberation..."" One would imagine, we're beyond being accommodated with new characters, but the author will quickly convince you otherwise, and introduction of new and interesting characters continues. It's great to see how Rowling keeps outperforming herself with each new book . Harry's ill-tempered nature and suspicions does not end with the last book as I hoped it would, but the results are quite the opposite this time around. Honestly, I did not anticipate the way how things turned out right till the last three chapters. ""To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair! We've been somewhat used to happy ending in the first four books (relatively) with 5th being a bit disappointing but this one, it was the most depressing ending for me yet. It probably comes down to reinforcing the suspense toward the final book but, it's a difficult place to be in - especially if you had to wait for a year..

"I'm not sure why, but this one took me completely by surprise. I was expecting this installment to be mainly filler to get us to the Deathly Hallows, but so much happened here that I must have forgotten from the movie. The Half-Blood prince was considerably darker than the previous 5 books, and I just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have. Obviously I knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before, but it didn't take away from the experience the novel had to offer. I have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one, but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series.",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",1

"I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children’s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn’t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn’t have been willing to admit in college that I’m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she’s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it’s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain’s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don’t know what these are. Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort’s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (“muggle” in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry). (Faulkner anyone?) But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother’s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the “muggle” blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents’ death. With Dumbledore’s help in exploring Voldemort’s past, Harry begins to understand that he’s come to be where he is through the choices he’s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that’s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort’s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",1
"Reminder that all of my Harry Potter reviews contain unmarked spoilers, and lots of ’em. If you’re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn’t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends: This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.) God, how do you talk about this book? It’s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life . For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful! Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that’s not true. I’ll just come out and say it: I’m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He’s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I’m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can’t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain. I’m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don’t like this at ALL. Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He’s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents’ legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he’s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages. I didn’t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn’t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book. Also, I’ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He’s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn’t last very long. Anyway. I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it’s a good thing she’s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she’s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry. Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone’s favorite character? He’s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh. Harry and Ginny I’m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU’RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don’t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks. Speaking of supposedly-good characters’ downfalls: I’m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don’t count. Harry and Hermione’s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that’s who I am, and she’s annoying in this book. AND IT’S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE’S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again. Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he’s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS. I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren’t here nearly enough. The price of Harry’s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I’M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I’d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.) But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it’s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It’s such a gorgeous setting and I’m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I’ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed. And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I’m really going to miss this series. I’ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it’s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I’m rereading it after 10 years, it’s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS. Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else’s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream. ----------ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------- Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead.

"Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of days, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as a power ballad. (Intro: Piano and strings) You were always by my side You will always be my guide But the road I'm on Goes on and on And I've left you beHIIIIIND! (Big crunchy electric guitar) (DUMBLEDORE!)

"For a long time this book had a special place in my freezer with my favorite ice creams and frozen food I was banned to cook (I eventually burn them when I defreeze them. I was born with non-culinary skills!) I repeated what Joey Tribbianni did because after finishing this book I cried so hard, I cursed nonstop, I screamed till my local cords declare their uselessness and I tried to throw the hardcopy out of the window but I changed my mind because an innocent kid may have found the book at the outside and started to read and cry nonstop! So instead of throwing away or burning the pages( which is so harsh punishment because this book is still a classic and it’s one of the best ones of the series)freezing the book and never forgiving the author for killing one of my favorite characters were the best choices I’ve had. As my new weekend quarantine habit: I started retro weekend tradition and reread my favorite series. Even though this book broke my heart more than a decade before, at least this time I prepared myself with lots of tissues and golden toilet papers( they’re so precious things and I hang them on the walls with hand sanitizers as if they’re historical artifacts.) and I bottled up my happy memories inside my head to protect my heart tear apart. This is sweet 16 adventures of Harry: the girl crushes, secret smiles, hormonal and characteristic changes, seeing the world from different aspect! If I didn’t get so sad with the unexpected ending, this might be second favorite HP book because JKR- wizard of the words reflected the emotional and psychical changing as they grow up more and realize the biggest danger out there to steal their best times of their lives. I never get bored to reread any HP books or anything JKR writes. (instead of shopping list. Lately they made me sleep!) So I had quite great time with my nostalgic journey to the past and realize I will find myself reading these books a decade later and I will still get the great taste of literature and have quality time. That’s the magic of skilled writing and gifted talent!",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",1
"Second Reread Review: REVIEW TO COME SOON ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 5 GLOWING MAGICAL STARS! 'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,' said Hermione. 'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' I'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over. *takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book ・。・゜★・。・。☆・゜・。・゜。・。・゜★・。・。☆・。・゜★・。・。 PHLEGM I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back. ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD Ron and Hermione I ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. Harry And Ginny have you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book 'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... Dumbledore's death I admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!",4.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",1
"It seems like by now, everyone would realize they should listen to Harry.. Such a sad end :( I knew that was going to happen before starting the series, but didn't know when.

"4.5 Golden Stars 92% yeah, it was dark, but probably the most Hilarious book of HP; it IS a Comedy! I was rolling in laughter! Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness & the unique fun in the writing style, the impression, the descriptions, the comparisons. anyway, don't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me. 3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & after that shocking end in book 5, looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end... in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading it. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.) & don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books. Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio) Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying. risking for no good reason, only his hunch. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him.) always yelling: Don't! No! you idiot, Harry! because he is my favourite character... (though now after many times re-reading, at some points, I found those parts hilarious too, ) at the end, he was right though. also, lack of funny sarcastic retorts between Harry & Draco :( almost whole events were like side-jobs (except the... you-know-what) A.K.A the Slug club truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his students... ughhhh. Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at an immediate, solid grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't solving mysteries (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) or something as intriguing as these. they were just attending classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff. though I like the classes & the Hogwarts routine, justt ass I enjoyed in book 5. whenever I missed Hogwarts this book, along with 5, is my go-to. just the Slug club ruined it a little. but in total, other parts (except Malfoy & Slug club); maybe not high peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, & funny; we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was great as always & the parts with Dumbledore were fascinating. I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action! & that end was the ""Beginning of the End""! But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!' , therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite. However.... on the bright side, there are parts I love too: ❤ sassy Harry was the best! There's no need to call me ""sir"", professor. Bless you JKR! Bless you Harry Potter! one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass masters! my first reaction when I see this, was: whaaaa!?... then ""omg! Harry! did you just...!?"" & re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down ( ""Hail Harry Potter!"" ) & burst out laughing! & that's that, ever since! although there was no sarcastic comebacks between Potter & Malfoy, but this book had many funny moments by other characters. ""Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow..."" (Gee! Thanks Ron!) ""I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!” & Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic, but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable. Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke with laughter! ❤ Friendships Harry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books. Roonil Wazlib! also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books. I actually noticed after years of rereading, now Romione has lowered in its place for me & I ship these two more. they care so much for each other. (I'm thinking it's probably also a brotp. well, it's complicated to decide if I want to accept the canon (because I do love canon too) or my mind. the point is, I love the moments with these two together :) ❤ the writing style is just Unique & perfect & funny! ❤ my favourite chapters are ""the Cave"" & ""Horcruxes""; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them. I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore. I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom. & how he unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters. ❤ I liked Dumbledore in this book. ❤ at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! ""... After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart. The creature in his chest roaring in triumph."" (& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :( ❤ & I was proud Harry became Team Captain ! Quidditch were funny, especially the first one ( You Clever Harry! XD ). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;) ❤ Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicately Rowling chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears. I love it. it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.) Hail Queen! 10th read ; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it (still things that annoy me) so I probably won't.

What this book tells me is that sadly the more conservative of readers, grammarians etc will place so many books above Harry Potter #6, none of which is worth mentioning in the same breath as Potter lore.

"Buddyread with the cutest *sniffs* I have actually finished this several days ago but I spent those days mourning for the loss of one of my favorite characters of all time and before I start bawling my heart and eyes out again, let me straight away proceed to the random thoughts while and after reading the book. *sniffs* 1. *Gasps* Professor Snape??? 2. Harry’s Quidditch Captain! Yaaas! 3. Weasleys’ Wizzard Wheezes (Say this ten times) 4. Malfoy’s head on Pansy Parkinson’s lap and Pansy stroking his head. *shudders* 5. Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door. Bahaha 6. Potions class has never been this cheerful. Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better. Thanks to cheating. Lol. 7. Ron, you bollocks! Stop being an idiot, WonWon! 8. Voldemort as a student seems to me even more sinister than the Dark Lord he already is. *shivers* 9. Like Harry, I am Dumbledore’s man through and through. Take that, Rufus! 10. I’d go back to school anytime if it meant having Professor Dumbledore as a teacher. 11. Aherm! Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry? 12. There’s a reason a Dark Arts teacher stays only for a year. It’s all clear now. 13. Who would have thought that the once timid Ginny will blossom into a confident, beautiful, charming, funny and best of all, snarky girl? 14. Chapter 24 will particularly make you swoon! Gaaah! I ship Harry and Ginny! <3 15. RIP, Aragog. 16. For the first time, I solved the mystery! I have guessed early on in the story that the Half Blood Prince was Snape! Yaaas! 17. I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore. I can’t… *sobs* Some of the things/characters missing in the movie: 1. Kreacher and Dobby 2. Bill and Fleur 3. Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters. 4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that’ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs* “In fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” “People find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.” “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” “Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it."" “The pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” “To the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.” “It’s not really goodbye after all.” On a lighter note, it's beautiful birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY! Even though you're quite busy for Goodreads and reading atm, I hope you're doing something that's making you happy today!

Times read: 5 One of the best books in this series. It does a great job of combining fun humor with action and heartbreak. My favorite movie is also based off of this book so of course this one will always hold a special place in my heart (although the movie should've included the Room of Requirement subplot because without that, there's a scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 that doesn't make sense-). The funeral in this book hits harder every time I read. The specific character's death isn't what makes me sad - it's everyone else's reactions, especially Hagrid's. The character (though controversial) meant a lot to so many of the characters and this series wouldn't be the same without him. If you're in the middle of reading this series for the first time, keep reading until you get to this one so that you can experience the highs and lows of Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts. You'll find out about so much stuff that the movie left out and this book is way more fast paced than some of the previous installments. My favorite quotes/moments from the book: -""'Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?' 'I will,' said Snape. A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire. 'And will you, to the best of your ability, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?' 'I will,' said Snape. A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain. 'And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail...' whispered Narcissa (Snape's hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), 'will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?' There was a moment's silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide. 'I will,' said Snape. Bellatrix's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery snake."" -""'Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,' said Dumbledore pleasantly. 'However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house.'"" -""'I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,' Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, 'but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.'"" -""The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself."" -""'You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.' 'Do I - do I have to keep him with me?' Harry asked, aghast as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. 'Not if you don't want to,' said Dumbledore. 'If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.'"" -""'Hagrid will be delighted,' said Dumbledore, smiling. 'He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak's safety, to rechristen him 'Witherwings' for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death."" -""'You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.' 'I didn't...' Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not. 'For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.'"" -""And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, 'Ouch!' 'Good evening, Horace,' said Dumbledore, straightening up again. Harry's jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly..."" -""...he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame - he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I'd have liked the set."" -""All ex-students, all signed.

People are always astonished to hear I'm on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!"" -""I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you."" -""'It was cruel,' said Dumbledore softly, 'that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.'"" -""'It's just hard,' Harry said finally, in a low voice, 'to realize he won't write to me again.'"" -""'...I reazlied I can't shut myself away or - or crack up. Siris wouldn't have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life's too short... Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance... It could be me next, couldn't it? But if it is,' he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, 'I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.' 'Spoken both like your mother and father's son and Sirius's true godson!'"" -""Don't count your owls before they are delivered..."" -""'Arthur, is that you?' 'Yes,' came Mr. Weasley's weary voice. 'But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!' 'Oh, honestly...' 'Molly!' 'All right, all right... What is your dearest ambition?' 'To find out how airplanes stay up.'"" -""'What do you like me to call you when we're alone together?' Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl. 'Mollywobbles,' whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door. 'Correct,' said Mr. Weasley. 'Now you can let me in.'"" -""A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray."" -""'You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about 'Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.' 'Oh... is she here too?' Harry croaked. 'No, no, silly boy,' said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, 'I mean next summer, when we - but do you not know?' Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, 'We hadn't got around to telling him yet.' Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face. 'Bill and I are going to be married!'"" -""Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right..."" -""Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke. 'Hermione!' shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash. Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purplle black eye. 'I squeezed it and it - it punched me!' she gasped. And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope."" -""He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him."" -""And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it - well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after the Death Eaters; Sirius's brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember."" -""'Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?' asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. 'The man who ran-' '-the ice cream place in Diagon Alley?' Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. 'He used to give me free ice creams. What's happened to him?' 'Dragged off, by the look of his place.'"" -""WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POO - THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION!"" -""There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties."" -""'Patented Daydream Charms...' Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 'One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know,' said Hermione, looking up at Harry, 'that really is extraordinary magic!' 'For that Hermione,' said a voice behind them, 'you can have one for free.' A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair."" -""'And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,' said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. 'You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.'"" -""She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. 'Pigmy Puffs,' said George. 'Miniature puff skeins, we can't breed them fast enough.' -""'That's three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,' said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron's arms. 'Cough up.' 'I'm your brother!' 'And that's our stuff you're nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I'll knock off the Knut.'"" -""...Bill and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer."" -""...their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks. safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages. 'Au revoir, 'Arry,' said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet."" -""...indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl. 'They're friends of mine,' said Harry coldly."" -""Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold)."" -""You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!"" -""'He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,' said Ginny. 'You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him...'"" -""...she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. 'Was that a Patronus?' asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this."" -""'I would rather die than betray his trust.' 'That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead,' Ron observed. 'Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,' said Nearly Headless Nick..."" -""'My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,' mumbled Neville. 'Take Charms,' said Professor McGonagall, 'and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.'"" -""'Yes,' said Harry stiffly. 'Yes, sir.' 'There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.'"" -""Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops."" -""They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have found at the Burrow."" -""Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!"" -""...he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them."" -"" Hissy, hissy, little snake, Slither on the floor, You be good to Morfin, Or he'll nail you to the door. "" -""Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated."" -""...Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pigmy Puff for a while..."" -""Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard."" -""POinting his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. 'Aaaaaaaargh!' There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle."" -""'There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!' said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head."" -""There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes."" -""Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood's famous lion-topped hat."" -""A tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan's; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked."" -""...Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator's podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, 'Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.'"" -""As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels."" -""She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small right of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair."" -"" 'Oppugno!' came shriek from the doorway. Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild; The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach."" -""'Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something going on between them...' 'Oh, ha ha...' Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other."" -""They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache..."" -""'A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day-'"" -And many more that I can't fit here!",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",1
"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince .   There were some things I truly loved about this one. I loved how the bulk of the book, nothing crazy happened. It felt like some of the older books and I love that feeling. All the Harry and Dumbledore time we got, the memories of Voldemort’s past (which were very interesting) and of course Harry and Ginny, who I’ve shipped for a while now finally got their shot. That’s the good. There is also a lot of sadness and despair. A very important and influential character dies. Sides are chosen. People you trust turn out to be not who they say they are (or so we think…) The last 2 hours of this 18 hour audio book broke my heart. I almost want to wait a while to do the final book, but I really want to finish these books by the end of 2016 so I better start it straight away. Wish me luck! I know I’ll need it xoxo",5.0,positive,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",1
