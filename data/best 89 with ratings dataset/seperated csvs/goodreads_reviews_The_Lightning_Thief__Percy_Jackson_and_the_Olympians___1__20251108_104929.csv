"Chiron looked surprised. “I thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles. ” As someone who has worked in Los Angeles, I can tell you that this is completely accurate. While Harry Potter was spending his summers at the Dursleys, Percy Jackson attended Camp Half-Blood. This book has done the impossible: it has redeemed the name of Percy. Yes, that's right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from the Harry Potter universe. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book. Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can't help sympathizing. He is the type that's born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can't help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds. Jay-Z's got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he's got dyslexia, he's got ADHD, and then there's Nancy Bobofit. Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap. “Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos. Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder. But I digress. As if the bullies aren't bad enough, his dad is a no-show, his stepfather is LITERALLY named Ugli, and there are crones foretelling Percy's death as well as a minotaur chasing his ass around. AND NOBODY'S TELLING HIM A SINGLE FUCKING THING. What's with all the secrecy, man? As it turned out, Percy is *whispers* special. He is a half-blood, meaning one of his parents is a Greek deity. He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him. It's a freaky place for a kid who's known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he's playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he's a doofus and she keeps calling him ""seaweed brain."" To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain. ""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.” “They must really like olives.” “Oh, forget it.” “Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.” “I said, forget it!” Not your best moment, Percy. As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that's not supposed to happen. “About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful."" A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really. Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive. Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there's some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)... ""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea always liked you best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera."" ...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone's stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it. Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he's got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name. He's not alone, he's accompanied by the snarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth (she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well as the most incompetent satyr that ever lived . In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff’s “So Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes. It's going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld. The Setting : THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, and the myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off . This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can't seem to keep it in their pants. Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.” “That’s...crazy.” “Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia?” And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses. “What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?” The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable. “Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it."" ""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods."" I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed. his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read. The Characters : Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He's got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won't be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He's kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you're a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE."" I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back. “Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.” “Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go home now.” He doesn't really want to do anything big. He's pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he's not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options. “All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.” I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can't say that I'm fond of Grover...but I can't help feeling that we'll be seeing more of him in the future. “But a quest to . . .” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.” Overall: a fantastic book. A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick. I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there's still a smile on my face that can't be wiped off.",4.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
"I'm slightly ashamed to say that I watched the movie before I read the book. But I'm even more ashamed that I watched the movie only to experience the hotness that is Logan Lerman. But, come on! Someone tell me that this , is not hot: Really. What did I tell you? (I do imagine that you probably won't read the rest of the review anf just stare at this gif instead, but that's no reason not to like my review! :D) But, I really have to thank Logan. I really do. Because without his unfreakingbelieveable hotness, I wouldn't have watched the movie, and I would've never read the awesomeness of The Lightning Thief. Yes, I loved the book. I've always taken an interest in Greek Mythology and I thought Rick Riordan's take on it was very unique, and unlike anything I've read before. I absolutely loved Camp- Halfblood. Well, it sure seemed better than the budget summer camps I've been to. RR seriously out did himself with writing the camp. I could imagine everything vividly and I like to think that I know the camp from back to front. The cabins would have to be my favourite feature of the camp, though. If only they were like that in the camps I've been to. Percy. What can I say? The guy has amazing underwater powers, is kick- ass and is a demigod. He's super loyal to his friends and family, is brave and has the looks (this is the part when you look at the gif of Logan Lerman again ;D). And he can make me laugh. Come on. You have to give a guy who make you laugh some credit. In short, the guy's the full package. Another thing I loved were the other characters. Especially Annabeth, who looks like Cinderella in Percy's words (am I right? I don't have the book on me, sorry. Stupid library fines). And I'm expecting something to develop between her and Percy, if you know what I mean.... So, yeah. I loved the book, it was exciting, fast- paced and humorous. Just one thing though, I'm kind of pissed that they didn't have cabins in the movie. Or Clarisse. Or the Oracle. Though it's hardly RR's fault. I just had to get it out there.",5.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
"When I was about halfway through this book, I started making a list of its similarities to Harry Potter. Here is a sampling from that list: 1. There are three young heroes: a brainy girl (Annabeth/Hermione), a funny screw-up type (Grover/Ron), and a somewhat troubled but very brave lead (Harry/Percy). 2. People freak when the Harry/Percy character says the name of a powerful character. 3. The main bad guy (Kronos/Voldemort) is seeking to return to his former power, but most people are totally in denial of that happening. 4. The heroes train at a school that divides its students according to their character. (Chiron, the head trainer of the camp, equals Dumbledore.) 5. Chiron/Dumbledore knows a prophecy about Percy/Harry but won't tell Percy/Harry what it is exactly. 6. Percy/Harry has a gross stepfather named Smelly Gabe who protects him during his childhood, so Smelly Gabe obviously equals the Dursleys. 7. Harry/Percy can talk to a certain animal because of his special gifts (Harry could talk to snakes, Percy can talk to horses). 8. Riordan's three young heroes face down a three-headed dog at the end of their big quest, which if I'm not mistaken is exactly what happens in HP1 (granted, the three-headed dog is straight out of Greek mythology, so I should cut Riordan some slack on this one). I could go on (and on and on) which would be fun for me, but I won't. Instead, I'll shock you by saying that I totally loved this completely derivative book. It's super fun and fast-moving and the fact that it's kind of a HP rip-off actually makes me like it more. God, I loved Harry Potter. The Lighting Thief is like methadone. That might be what I said about the but it's more true here. I can't wait to read the second one!",4.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
"Chapter One: I Accidentally Vaporize the Person who Tried to Take this Book Away from Me Look, I didn't want to be obsessed. If you're reading this because you think you're only going to read The Lightning Thief once, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about binge-reading, and try to be a normal person. Being obsessed with this book is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed because you want to read it just one more time. If you're a normal kid, reading this book because you were forced to, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe you're immune to being obsessed. But if you recognize yourself in these pages - if you feel something stirring inside - stop reading immediately. You might be becoming a member of the Percy Party. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before you read it again. And again. And again.

"Were you a bit weird in school? Or are you still in school and think you're kinda weird? I mean, everyone is weird, but you know that I mean. Maybe you didn't fit in, maybe people thought you were a bit of a loser. Maybe you had learning difficulties, were a target for bullies, got into trouble a lot, maybe it seemed like your teachers just didn't like you. Maybe you sucked at reading and were even diagnosed with dyslexia. Or ADHD. Well, don't worry. Truth is, you're actually most likely a child of the gods with secret powers that enable you to zap those bullies and fulfill your true destiny. Screw school, you've got bigger things to deal with anyway. Lol, this book is amazing. My only regret is that I didn't have it when I was twelve years old because I would have read this until it was falling apart in my hands. Every insecure kid (so basically every kid) should read The Lightning Thief . I would want my hypothetical kids of the future to read this book. It's the ultimate childhood fantasy - discovering that everything people labelled as ""weird"" or negative about you is actually caused by your secret awesomeness. Pretty perfect message, if you ask me. I know, I know - this is plain old childhood wish fulfillment at its finest. But who cares? The best kids books are all about wish fulfillment to some extent and it's not like Percy Jackson doesn't have his fair share of enemies and heartache. It's the same idea that we all loved to buy into. The orphaned and neglected Harry Potter discovering he is a wizard. The nerdy loser-ish Peter Parker developing special abilities and becoming Spiderman. Children in the middle of WWII discovering a secret world through a wardrobe door in which they reign as royalty. Percy Jackson finding out he is the son of a god and has his own super powers. On top of the powerful message, this is a fast-paced exciting fantasy story full of friendships, Greek mythology, magic, mystery, bad guys and girls, and constant adventure. I enjoyed it now, despite me being a good ten years older than the target audience. I would have enjoyed it even more ten years ago. You should definitely go read this. Then, when you're done, give it to a kid to read too. | | | | |",4.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
"Mythological Bliss. Percy Jackson is a spunky teenage boy attending Yancy Academy. His life turning upside down when during a school trip to a museum he is attacked and nearly killed by a harpy. Not every day you realize you are the illegitimate son of a god and that you are being hunted down by mythological monsters. What follows is a narrow escape to Camp Half Blood, home and refuge for all the unrecognized offspring of the many Olympus deities. Things do not get better when he realizes his birth signifies the violation of a sacred millennial oath, gets accused for stealing the thunder of Zeus, and the possibility of a full scale heavenly war escalating to a point of no return. 2014 was the best year of my young reader’s life. Bought a tablet, discovered Goodreads, and with it an endless sea of possibilities and books I never knew existed. That year I devoured all the Giver, Hunger Games and Divergent series one after the other, but Percy Jackson was my very first. I just loved Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Sally. Hated so much Gabe! And Clarisse, at least at the beginning. I was completely enamored by the world building and all of its fantastic characters, the greek mythology references, the never ending reveals, the engrossing story progression, and the nonstop action. This book was unmatched YA heaven. How can I ever forget Camp Half Blood, the Lotus Casino, the fights against so many mythological figures like the Minotaur, the Furies, Medusa, Echidna, Chimera, Ares, Cerberus... So many endearing and heartbreaking moments to remember by The Minotaur and the Pearl scenes! . The big ending reveal with Luke was kind of a letdown, but a very decent ending nonetheless. And hey, what book is perfect? It was so close though! A terrific beginning for one of my most beloved fantasy series ever. Highly Recommendable for YA Fantasy lovers, and adults with a child at heart. *** The movie (2010) was a joke and one of the most disappointing adaptations I've ever watched. I mean it was so awkwardly filmed! The moderately faithful plot and the great special effects were there, granted, and maybe even some of the acting too; but it all felt so clumsy and disjointed! And so many things were cut out. It was all so sad, the intention was clearly there, but the spirit was definitely not. Hardly a match to the book. Lerman and Daddario may have been ok, at best; but Brosnan as Chiron was so laughable. And the ending so insulting to the series progression! Fighting Kronos? Really??? Like they couldn’t wait to throw the biggest final antagonist of the series right at the beginning. And inexperienced newcomer Percy winning so easily, against the most dreadfully powerful god ever. Give me a break! Sadly, Not Recommendable. Many points to Sean Bean for not dying though! ----------------------------------------------- PERSONAL NOTE : [2005] [377p] [Fantasy] [YA] [Highly Recommendable] ----------------------------------------------- ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ [4.5] ★★★★★ ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ [4.5] ----------------------------------------------- Felicidad Mitológica. Percy Jackson es un aventurado jovenzuelo asistiendo a la Academia Yancy. Su vida dando un vuelco total cuando durante una visita escolar a un museo es atacado y casi asesinado por una harpía. No todos los días te enterás que sos el hijo ilegítimo de un dios y que estás siendo cazado por monstruos mitológicos. Lo que sigue es un estrecho escape a Campo Mestizo, hogar y refugio para todos los no reconocidos descendientes de las muchas deidades del Olimpo. Las cosas no mejoras cuando comprende que su nacimiento significa la violación de un milenario pacto, es acusado de robar el rayo de Zeus, y la posibilidad de una guerra celestial a gran escala se acerca a un punto de no retorno. 2014 fue el mejor año de mi joven vida lectora. Compré una tablet, descubrí Goodreads, y con ello un océano infinito de libros y posibilidades que jamás sabía que existía. Ese año devoré todos los libros de la saga Dador, Juegos del Hambre y Divergente uno tras de otro, pero Percy Jackson fue mi más primero. Simplemente amé a Percy, Annabeth, Grover y Sally. ¡Odié tanto a Gabe! Y a Clarisse, al menos al principio. Completamente fascinado por la construcción del mundo y todos sus maravillosos personajes, las referencias a la mitología griega, las continuas revelaciones, la cautivante progresión de la historia, y la acción sin final. Este libro fue tan completamente un cielo de lo Joven Adulto. Cómo podría olvidar el Campamento Mestizo, el Casino Loto, las peleas contra tantas figuras mitológicas como el Minotauro, las Furias, Medusa, Equidna, Quimera, Ares, Cerbero… Tantas entrañables y terribles momentos para recordar ¡La escena del Minotauro y las Perlas! . La gran revelación final con Luke fue un poco decepcionante, pero un decente final sin embargo. Y además, ¿qué libro es perfecto? ¡Aunque estuvo tan cerca! Un espectacular comienzo para una de mis más queridas series de fantasía jamás. Altamente Recomendable para los amantes de la Fantasía Joven Adulto, y adultos con un niño en el corazón. *** La película (2010) fue una gansada y una de las más decepcionantes adaptaciones que vi jamás. ¡O sea fue todo tan raramente filmado! La trama moderadamente fiel y los geniales efectos especiales estuvieron ahí, concedido, y tal vez incluso algo de la actuación también; ¡pero todo se sintió tan mal e inconexo! Y tantas cosas dejadas afuera. Fue todo tan triste, la intención claramente estuvo ahí, pero el espíritu definitivamente no. Difícilmente comparable al libro. Lerman y Daddario tal vez estuvieron ok, cuando mucho; pero Brosnan como Quirón fue lamentable. ¡Y el final tan insultante a la progresión de la serie! ¿Pelear contra Cronos? ¿¿¿En serio??? Como si no pudieran esperar para lanzar al mayor antagonista final de la serie directo al principio. Y el inexperto recién llegado Percy ganándole tan fácilmente, contra el más terriblemente poderoso dios jamás. ¡Por favor! Lamentablemente, No Recomendable. ¡Aunque muchos puntos para Sean Bean por no morir! ----------------------------------------------- NOTA PERSONAL : [2005] [377p] [Fantasía] [Joven Adulto] [Altamente Recomendable] -----------------------------------------------",4.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187

And he did become the greatest of them all 😌 ~•~•~ Original review Look, I didn't want to get sucked into the world of PJO. If you think it's not that deep, great I envy you. If you recognise yourself in my over dramatic reviews and updates- ahh okay I'll stop😂 Honestly this book holds a special place in my heart. I randomly picked it up in my school library years ago simply cause I was bored. But once I started reading, I knew this book was IT. I DEVOURED it. Just like I did today lol. Percy Jackson has always been one of my all time favourite characters. And re-reading this series is going to be major FUN. I honestly miss books like these.

"EDIT 09/06/2013:- That's it. I have had my fill of too many stupid, brain-cell destroying comments posted on this review in the past few months asking me to write a 'best-selling book' before attempting to take apart Rick Riordan's writing. As if the exclusive privilege of negatively criticizing a book is accorded only to published writers and not ordinary reviewers/readers. I do have the right to record my feelings about a book in my review. And it's such a shame that I am actually being forced to put up this edit to make people aware of this fact. If this review hurts your sentiments as a fan, I am sorry I can't help you there. You must grow up and learn to let dichotomous opinions co-exist in harmony on the same page. That is all. Caution:- Brutal honesty ahead. Read at the expense of having to respect someone else's views. --------- What a feeble attempt at recreating the Harry Potter magic! Aside from being highly unoriginal and unimaginative, the book grates on your nerves due to the frequency of Percy's lame attempts at sounding witty. Seriously, I'm supposed to laugh at his observations on the 'Bull Man' and 'barnyard animals' ? Not only did the writer not bother racking his brains to come up with a plot or a proper story, choosing instead to recycle key elements of the Harry Potter series, but he also ignored important aspects of a fantasy novel, one of which is the language. To call the narration just bad will be an understatement. Same can be said about the dialogue and the way the plot progresses - it's one cliched event unfolding after another. The only novel thing about this book is the seamless integration of Greek mythology into a fantasy-based set-up. The 1 star is for that. And so I'd like to put a premature end to my review because I just realized the futility of writing one of a book I hated.",1.0,negative,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
"I've read all (I think) of this series to my daughter, Celyn, but somehow this one escaped being reviewed until now. I half-watched the film a year or two before we read this. Actually it was Rick reading (and being kind enough to review) my own trilogy that steered me toward picking up these books for Celyn (she's very disabled and can't read books for herself). Anyway, it was a very good read. Celyn enjoyed the action and humour, and I enjoyed seeing the Greek legends I loved reading about as a kid given a new lease of life, offered up to the most recent generation. It starts off with that irresistible device beloved of fantasy books that you (vicariously the hero) were meant for more than this regular old world and that all those odd things you don't understand about everyday life ... really are odd and full of special meaning. In fact ... your dad's a god, and not just any old god but Poseidon himself. And that means you're part god yourself! Hoorah! So Percy gets inducted into hero school, makes friends with good monsters, fights and kills bad ones, and dives into adventure. The hero school (Camp Halfblood) has demi-gods descended from all the Greek mythos, which makes for fun conflicts. Meanwhile in the wider world there are rumblings that the titans (from whom the gods wrested control of the world at the dawn of time) are about to stage a comeback. Zeus has lost his lightning bolt and the thief must be found before the gods fall to blows and Olympus topples. The genius is in the mix of modern day America with all its kitsch, landmarks, cities etc with mythical Greece. It shouldn't really work, but does.

"""You need to study war, punk."" Given how well received this book is (and the entire series), I was looking forward to continue my fantasy to-read list with Percy Jackson and the Olympians for a while now. I know it's children's book, but when has that ever stopped me.. But still, one cannot help but be somewhat anxious while starting a new series, for things could go either way. And when things turn out better than expected - like it did with Lightening Thief - life is beautiful. This is a wonderful little story, and hopefully the first of many, of an interesting series. ""Remarkable, really, the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of reality."" Being a children's story, it's understandable that character building plays the bigger role compared to setting up the environment. Still, I think the environs were adequately defined. The main characters - including the first person protagonist - were interesting, fun and delightful to observe. However, for me, the secondary characters appeared a little too funny, even when they were supposed to be threatening. It took away some of the suspense/ thrill that could've been there in my opinion. And also, if the set of main characters were a little older, may be things would appear a little more realistic (relatively). But as the plot itself is great, it's easy to forget those shortcomings, and enjoy the story. Obviously, none of these would matter to kids at all, who will find the entire thing to be quite entertaining. Sequence of events is very well thought out, and laid out in a way that will make you want to read the entire thing in one go, which is not difficult to do actually, as the book is not very long. Everything is well written, and well capable of intriguing one to continue with the rest of the series (which I'll be doing shortly).

"“The real world is where the monsters are.” Believe it or not, but this was actually my first Rick Riordan book!!! AND I really enjoyed it!!! *lol* This was such an epic adventure and I loved the countless hints and references to Greek Mythology! XD Rick Riordan’s approach definitely was a more than just funny one and I couldn’t help but had to laugh out loud whenever Percy opened his mouth! I swear that young boy is the embodiment of sass and the more I read about him, the more I got attached to this awesome boy! <3 I want to adopt Perseus and if Poseidon doesn’t want him it’s his own fault! XD After reading the first book I don’t really feel a connection to Annabeth , but maybe this is going to change?! She seemed to be an interesting character and I liked their easy banter, altogether she was just too reserved for my taste though, which is pretty sad because I’m more than just certain that she’s actually a very cool girl! (On a side note: I really loved that she gave Percy the nickname “Seaweed Brain”! *lol* I’m fairly certain it could have been worse! ;-P) And Grover ? Well, I guess I liked Grover as well! His habit to eat tin cans was a little unsettling but hey, I’m not going to judge him for his rather questionable diet. XD After all his heart is in the right place and when it comes down to it, this is everything that counts! ;-P I just hope he’ll survive his personal quest and I can’t help but wonder if we’re going to see him in one of the next books! Since my jump on the “Percy Jackson” train seems to be more than just a little delayed, I finally decided to leave it at that. I guess there is really nothing I could write or say that hasn’t been said already! I mean there are actually 73.916 reviews on goodreads! (Yes, I looked it up! ;-P) So yeah, I guess that says it all! XD If you haven’t had the pleasure to read the book yet I recommend you to do the following though: Get a copy of “The Lightning Thief” , snuggle into your soft and comfy bed, ignore the bad autumn weather and enjoy the freaky ride! ;-P",4.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187

"I just had to get the illustrated edition! It's so awesome! I will leave some pics below and I took them last night so they are not great shots. =) There are A LOT more pictures as you can guess. Like I said, sorry about the darkish pics. I was taking them while laying in bed last night. Lol Happy Reading! Mel ♥ ••••••••••• First Reading I am FINALLY getting around to reading this series. I thought the movies were okay, I do wish they would remake them and make them better, like the books =) Poor Percy. Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close the book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life. Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways. If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. But if you recognize yourself in these pages-if you feel something stirring inside-top reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they'll come for you. Don't say I didn't warn you. My name is Percy Jackson. Most people already know the story of Percy Jackson and how he found out he was a half-blood. How he ended up in a half-blood camp (almost didn't) How he beat a Minotaur and later on, many things. I thought it was a fun read and I loved all of the different mythical creatures! That was so wicked cool! Percy makes some good friends in the camp and they go with him to do a quest. He has been blamed for stealing something from Zeus, which he did not, so they have to set out to find who really did it. Other wise there is going to be some knock down drag out with Zeus and Percy's father (Poseidon) and others of course. So they set out on this quest. They have to go have a little chat with Hades <-- fun times. They get attacked by many creatures of all shapes and sizes. They also get help from certain creatures and a pink poodle named Gladiola who ran away from home and doesn't want to go back but does so the kids can have some reward money. Wasn't that sweet! ↑ Can you blame little Gladiola? I mean I love the color pink, but NO, JUST NO! Anyhoo, I did want to smack the group a few times because of stupid things, but who doesn't do those from time to time. *raises hand* I loved when they saved the animals in the old truck they were riding in, Grover is awesome! I look forward to reading ALL of the other 50 billion books in this ongoing Rick Riordan world! ♥ MY BLOG:",5.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
"Perfect for those who love mythology This should come as no big shocker given that my pen name is Lisa of Troy, but I love Greek mythology. The problem with Greek mythology is that the language is so archaic that I usually spend more time reading the reference materials than the original text. Recently, there have been some efforts to modernize the myths and make them more accessible. The Lightning Thief jumps right into action, no 100-page warm-up here. No droning on and on about Greek mythology. It is also highly readable with short paragraphs and sentences. One thing that I didn’t like is the portrayal of the Greek gods. In Greek mythology, the gods are heartless. No one is safe even children. This is one aspect that makes mythology so shocking; it doesn’t follow traditional social norms. The Lightning Thief is geared towards the YA audience, so I suppose Riordan made the right call in toning the book down a bit. The Lightning Thief is so good that I picked up a buddy reader. I was listening to the audiobook on the couch (that happens more than you would think), and my family member started listening too. I kept asking if I could read the book by myself, and I kept being told, “No! No! You have to wait for me!” We ended up reading the entire book in about two days. Would I read the next book in the series? You bet! 2025 Reading Schedule Jan	A Town Like Alice Feb	Birdsong Mar	Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De Berniere Apr	War and Peace May	The Woman in White Jun	Atonement Jul	The Shadow of the Wind Aug	Jude the Obscure Sep	Ulysses Oct	Vanity Fair Nov	A Fine Balance Dec	Germinal Connect With Me!",5.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
"Riordan enters the Mount Olympus of comedic fantasy By smartly combining the old classic tales with modern settings It´s a bit like Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman, just as a longer series and with a focus on fast, funny, and creative clashes of old mythology and today's life. The message, as so often, is that It´s completely ok to be different And that individual character traits and issues are nothing that legitimizes stigmatization, or the tendency to give pills and psychotropic drugs instead of alternatives such as therapy in not so severe cases. But that´s more of an unimportant sidenote, the really big riddle and mystery is the question which manifestation of a classic god will come next in which outfit, style, and with which modified abilities. This searching for the signs, hints, and innuendos is What makes it so appealing for adult readers too It´s not just quick, clever, and witty, one is also permanently questioning which obvious or deep and subtle disguise ones favorite mythological figure might have chosen. Riordan milked this concept in other series with different mythologies from around the world, or at least Scandinavia and Egypt (as far as I know but I´m a bit outdated so there might already be fresher serialized stuff ) and it always worked out fine because it´s so fresh and original. And even Gods have to evolve to stay up to date, funky, and fresh for the true believer. If you like that kind of easygoing, but still ironic and somewhat even postmodern, kind of entertainment in the comedic fantasy YA and adult sector, Terry Pratchett, Jonathan Stroud, Walter Moers, Brandon Mull, and everything in similar amazon comparison or goodreads listopia genre/author meta suggestion function could be your new reading drug of choice. But be aware, it´s such fun to consume that one tends to just read dozens of these giggle pearls instead of more complex and difficult to read stuff. At least if one is such a lazy master procrastinator as I am. Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:",5.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187

"My inner child is absolutely devastated that I didn't read this series when I was a kid. Percy Jackson was one of those series that was always there, just on the periphery of my social conscious. I knew I should read it, but for one reason or another I gravitated to other things instead. Thankfully, as an adult who likes reviewing books for fun in my spare time, I have absolutely no shame about reading the series now, even if it was originally intended for a younger audience. In some ways, I think I might have even enjoyed it more as an adult. I'm a huge fan of Greek mythology. (I may or may not have filled electives in high school and college with classes on mythology; just like I may or may not have obsessed over shows like Xena and Hercules in my teenage years.) I had a great time comparing my own personal knowledge of Greek mythology against the ways that Riordan weaves the stories into Percy's larger adventure. It's such a fun way to introduce Greek mythology to children and teens while staying entertaining for adults as well! The mythology remains faithful to the original stories, but it feels fresh and fun here as each character is full of personality and charm. The world is full of magic and wonder and I never once felt bored as the characters explored within it. Speaking of characters full of personality, Percy Jackson himself is one of my new faves in terms of characterization. He's brave, loyal and hilarious and his friendship with Grover and Annabeth has quickly become a favorite for me. Also, can I just say that I think it's so cute that Riordan based Percy on his son, who had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia? I think it's so awesome that Percy gets to sort of stand apart from other heroes in stories as a champion for those kids forevermore. When I finished reading this book, I immediately went and told my 11 year old nephew that he absolutely had to read this book so I had someone to talk to about it. I'm proud to call myself a Percy Jackson fan and will be continuing the rest of the series shortly! ★★★★★ = 5 stars!

"this is one of the most common books that pops up on my feed. no joke. i probably see this at least a couple times a week, so i finally gave in and read it! yay me! hehe. i will admit, this is the first time i have read a middle grade novel since i was that age, but i have to hand it to rick riordan. this story is sooo unique, which is hard to do considering how many fantasy novels are out there for young readers. and i have no doubt that, if i had first read when i was a kid, i would have been beyond OBSESSED with it. it makes me so sad to think that my childhood missed out on this series. but reading this as an adult is an entirely different experience. i can appreciate this for what it is, which is fun and exciting, but it honestly just made me feel old as it has a very juvenile feel to it. i have heard some of riordans other books are aimed towards older readers, so i may give them a shot since i do love me some greek mythology! ↠ 3.5 stars",4.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187

"Really is there something I could say that hasn't been said? Doubtful, but in utterly stupid human style I will write a review anyway attempting to tell people how cool this book is. This is plainly an awesome idea. I had always wondered what happened to the kids of half gods/goddess and humans. Here's the story to quench your curiosity. Percy Jackson has been dumped around from border school to border school. He has never been quite like anybody else, but as the end of sixth grade approaches he'll find out how unique he actually is... I picked this up thinking that I would enjoy it, but not to the extent of really being hooked so fast. Literally from the first pages I knew I was gonna finish this book. It's geared towards middle grade readers and mostly male I think, but really all that goes away when you're reading this. As an older reader I did see most of the twists coming but that is because the author is generous about hints, which I have always liked. What really sold it for me though is the action. I have mentioned this numerous times, but I'll say it again, I am a total sucker for action scenes . Give me a good fight sequence and I'm there. A few reviews mention how this is ripoff of Harry Potter, and now that I think about it I could see where they are coming from. There are definitely similarities, but to be honest I didn't really catch that, (I guess I'm kind of dim...I shouldn't probably admit to that *shakes head* moving on) because the world the author set was so original that the similar setup can be easily forgiven. We all love heroes. Especially ones like Percy. People never expect much from him, and that's what makes this journey of his so personal to the reader. You root for him and are so glad that his muscling his way through it. It has the feel of cheering for the underdog. And I'm guessing this underdog is going to blow everyone out of the water.

"4.5 Golden stars first of all! & second, ""Read Rick Riordan's books in English or you'll miss half the FUN!"" I saw that happened! This Book/Series/Universe is a ""must read"" for anyone who loves myths, Regardless of Age. {for proof: I read it first when I was 22 & fell in love immediately by the first sentences! (which was the chapter's title!) though it probably depends on you enjoy humour & like a good laugh over silly things, or just funny narrator & have an active inner child & love Mythology in modern days with lots of fun. (my dad liked it too.) it's an art to write a book suitable for everyone. & Percy's character reminded me of one of my teenage years book crushes, Bobby series by D. J. MacHale; sassy, quick witty comebacks with funny thoughts & comparisons in the narration. First book in the masterpiece of Riordanverse, First book in I LOVE ALL UNCLE RICK'S BOOKS! the way it started, from the very first page, it shows & promises how amazing & funny it would be. I mean, just look at the chapters name! I laughed with almost every sentences! (also full of ""I-can-relate"" moments!) 2019: I recommended this to my dad & he actually liked it! another proof that this story is regardless of age. finished a day before Percy's birthday! [August 17] I love finding relatable things in my life & my fandoms 2024: I wanted to make sure this book is still as great as I remembered, after my bad experience with the audiobook years ago &... good news is: IT IS! I enjoyed it very much, just like good old times (wow, 10 years since I've known these books. not on the first fan train, but it is a nostalgia for me now) - plot (excitements): ★★★★/5 the start was amazing also the way magic & myths related the real world & wrapping up the story. I love this way that myths got modernized. in general, full of excitements & surprises! - World building: ★★★★★/5 the real world & its relation to myths world, is very realistic, the way I can assume it is real & actually can be happening somewhere! - Characters: ★★★★★/5 many lovable characters! Percy is awesome. also Grover & Annabeth<3 & Sally Jackson is an Angel! strong & supportive. - Written style: ★★★★★/5 even though it is first person view, but Percy is awesome narrative. & Riordan KNOWS how to write FUNNY & also giving us the Adrenaline Surge! HUMOR!: ★★★★★/5 LOL like after every sentence! “She'd also called me brave...unless she was talking to the catfish.” - General idea: ★★★★★/5 Real world+Mythology+Fantasy: Sign me in",5.0,positive,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",28187
