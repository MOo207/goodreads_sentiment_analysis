"the potential this book has is staggering but the lack of refinement makes this subpar at best. you could cut this book in half and it would still be the exact same story just waaaay less exhausting. bcos the parts that weren’t a snoozefest? they hit hard for me, ngl. there were some seriously cute moments between Rowan and Zahra— especially some of the special things Rowan did for her. with the book signing, the dinners, the drawings, etc. and hands down, Rowan and Ani’s interactions were the superior parts of this book. i will die on this hill!! but the parts of this that were insufferably boring?? i wanted to give this three stars. but the way i skimmed the fuck out of the last quarter of this book. like you best believe i was i will tell you why this book exhausted me so much— the contradictions. the first one being, this is supposed to be a slowburn. and it is... in a way. but the insta-lust definitely undermines the slowburn aspect – like they kiss for the first time around the 20% mark? then they spend the rest of the first half of the book afterwards wondering in their internal dialogues if the other likes them/if there’s anything going on between them... girl you felt his dick in the boardroom two days ago, im taking a wild stab in the dark and saying yes. it was just so strange. idk how to articulate how i felt reading them go back and forth after their kiss. it felt as though the author added the kiss to placate the readers who don’t like slowburn. then for the readers who do like slowburn, get to see Zahra and Rowan go painfully back and forth for the rest of the book... best of both worlds?! but it failed miserably imo. the other example that stood out to me was when Rowan admits to Zahra he’s Scott... that is a whole other can of worms i ain’t even touching bcos wtf. but when he apologises, Rowan basically declares how obsessed and infatuated he is with Zahra, how he can’t think of anyone else but her. how she’s makes him a better person. blah blah blahhhh... then when they have sex right after, Rowan tells her this can’t be anything more than causual between them? my guy, you basically just declared you’re in love with her without using the word love. and you’re both agreeing to this relationship being causal? followed by a date in the city at the most expensive restaurant where a single glass of wine is £200 and you’re legit dressed up like you’re going to a ball? hmmm, yeah casual as fuck that. then he whisks her away to New York and plans a whole book event and meet and greet with her favourite author... then immediately rebukes that she’s his gf. it made zero sense and was so annoying to read. like if he was doing the bare minimum while insisting they were causal, fine. but when they talk like a couple. act like a couple. think like a couple. then they’re a couple. so it felt like a weak way to just prolong the already exhaustingly long plot that should have ended when Rowan admitted he was Scott. Lauren Asher needed to pick a conflict and stick with it. there were too many overlapping ones that i struggled to identify what was *bad* and what was just a regular piece of the plot. so the contradictions just kept undermining the romance and it was so damn annoying. idk if it was the author’s way to cause conflict? to drag shit out waaay longer than it had to. bcos i am telling you right now. this book could have been 200 pages shorter and nothing would have been different. it’s just filled with a lot of base, repetitive filler in these small pockets of boring interactions. any time i had something to finally sink my teeth into, it was yanked away for the repetitive formula to start up again: of Rowan and Zahra bickering at work, saying the same things over and over and over again. to Rowan and Zahra having the same thoughts and dilemmas about each other, over and over and over again. to them talking online about the same things... you get the picture right? i will give another example bcos i am putting my English degree to good use😌 Zahra says this to Rowan at 67%: “I think you hate how much you want me. Because to care about me means you have to admit to having a heart.” I place a soft kiss against his lips. “So keep telling yourself those pretty little lies. Your secret is safe with me.” she gives a bit of a monologue, this is just a snippet of it. now this is cute or whatever... but this has been established already. like approximately three or four times?? during Rowan’s huge declaration i mentioned earlier, all of this is established – that he low-key hates how much he wants her. so why tf do you have to keep telling me every few pages, maam? i get it. you don’t have to bat me over the head with the same poetical, flowery nonsense. any chance they got, it was reiterated that Rowan made Zahra ✨feel✨and they would admit to one another how much they meant to each other... while keeping things casual. y’all need to look up the definition of casual in the dictionary bcos i think you’ve got the wrong idea. this particular repeated sentiment just heightened my awareness of just how much of this book was filler content. it got to the point where id read an interaction or a conversation or an inner monologue and think “swear to god i have already read this??” probably why it took me so long to read and why i then ended up skimming the ending. i just loathe in books when there’s truly nothing keeping the MCs apart anymore and they both know they have feelings for each other. yet do precisely nothing about it and aren’t together... for what? angst? drama? conflicts? bcos to me, y’all just look fucking dumb as shit. and it annoys me so much bcos this had potential for me to be really good! you best believe i am reading Declan and Cal’s books... Cal, sir👀 if you’re looking for a heroine for your book look no further baby😘 i fluctuated so much with the characters. one minute i loved Zahra and was riding the Rowan-hate train... then after one small conversation or interaction my feelings would do a reverse uno and it was Rowan i was rooting for while Zahra was the one grating on my last nerve. it was draining to keep up with them. slowburn gotta deliver the delicious burn to compensate from being so slow. but their back and forth just burnt my brain cells to a crisp. i hope i make sense bcos at this point, i feel like im rambling since trying to articulate my thoughts is a struggle😭 that being said. i liked the moments i liked... if that makes sense. if i could cut all the useless shit out of this book, the way this would be soooo good. it had the bones of a good book, just Lauren Asher needed to decide what she wanted this book to be. slowburn or insta-lust? then the grumpy-sunshine, the workplace aspect with forced proximity and the boss and employee dynamic, the talking online but not knowing you know each other in real life... it just needed so much refinement. for real, someone needs to get Lauren Asher and editor. and if she already has one they need to be fired. random side note: whenever characters have sex in cars, i really want their chauffeurs to slam the breaks on while they’re fucking and send the bitches flying. y’all need to pull your trousers up and put yourself seatbelts on for fuck sake. can’t you wait??!",2.0,negative,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390
"1.5⭐️ ""There’s nothing in the world I’ll find more beautiful than her. Not the sun. Not the moon. Not even the entire galaxy compares to the light she radiates wherever she goes.” me reading this book: my mom: is it that bad? me: i don’t understand the hype with this book. i mean there was potential somewhere in the storyline but goddamn it, it was a MESS. i'm lying.. no potential whatsoever. its just bad. i also don't know why i picked up this book after dnfing it. i felt bad and i want to read the second book but this was torture. this was so INSTA lust INSTA everything. ugh. his dick twitched in chp2, she was panting by chp3. they kissed by chp9 while also grinding against each other. idk these characters yet why are they making out already? i don’t feel anything for them yet i don’t feel the chemistry, like CHILL we are only 18% in and its just TOO fast??? they didn't do anything romantic until like 51%?? so why couldn't it have been a semi slowburn instead of this insta lust and then nothing for over 40%?? “Lucifer: Please tell me where you are? Me: Look at you using the word please. And people say old dogs can’t learn new tricks. ” also idk what is up with this relationship dynamic but no fucking boss and employee talk this way? she’s yelling at him and saying shit as if he’s not her boss? get off your high horse tbh where is the respect? i’m tired of authors writing sunshine girls as stupid bitches with no filter. make them polite PLEaSE. this is a workplace romance not the fucking zoo. i lost all my respect to zahra. i don't like stupid bitches who act like they are above everyone else. bitch he gave you a promotion, ignored your rude words and then still call him an asshole to HIS face?????????????? “If you act like a child, then you’ll get treated like one. Goodbye!” I wave over my shoulder as I power walk out of his vicinity. ” “Seriously, what kind of idiot complains about a woman having curves? Off the record, your body is hot as fuck.” Her cheeks turn into two red splotches. “Please pretend I didn’t say anything.” “Why?” “Because we shouldn’t be having this conversation. You’re my boss,” she whispers the words as if someone can hear us. ” so now he’s your boss? but when u called him an asshole to his face he wasn’t? i don't understand this girl. i just want to punch her all the time. also she just has lots of embarrassing moments. she acted like an idiot all the time. me every time zahra opened her mouth: but also me: don't get me started on rowan or should i say the most boring man to ever live . i can't believe i'm saying this but alex from twisted love is 10x better than daddy issues rowan. “I’ve always prided myself on the ability to remove my emotions from any kind of business decision.” SHUT UPPPPPPP rowan. he was the most emotional lil shit throughout this whole book. he acted with his dick the whole time because if he removed his emotions during work he would've fired zahra instead of cornering her after her presentation and sticking his erection. please. ah yes all this shit happened in the first 30% . idk what happened after that bc it was so boring i picked up 7 other books to forget about this. their romance was so bland and forced i couldn't appreciate a single sentence. but one thing i noticed in almost ALL romance books is this: “I want to kiss Rowan until his lips are swollen and the sad look in his eyes is replaced by lust. Part of me wants to go back in time and protect that little boy who wanted nothing more than to dream and draw and be who he was without being attacked for it.” why when someone explains their trauma and shit someone always gets horny? i don't get it???? and this sentence just makes me icky. he's saying stuff that happened to him as a kid and you want to make him horny???? WHATT??? first read; DNF @ 19% idk i feel nothing for them might try again next year ffs",1.0,negative,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390
"4.25 stars The way I drool over men that are absolute dicks is actually sad at this point. Like, where is my hot-as-shit billionaire boss that gives me dirty looks, but is secretly lusting after me??? summary: Rowan (H) is the Director of a Disney-like amusement park called Dreamland and Zahra (h) is an employee of Dreamland that is promoted to a Creator, they propose new ideas to Rowan to try and improve the park. Rowan and Zahra start off as hating each other, but quickly become friends and eventually they're in love 🥰 Now, back to what I was saying before. I love when heroes judge the heroine and even embarrass them. I just think it's hilarious and to be honest the banter in this is incredible ""Will this be a habit while you're on the clock?"" ""Oh no! I barely drink. It was a stupid idea to help me unwind—"" He lifts his hand. ""Save me the monologue. I don't care."" Could this man not be anymore of a mood? Like just stfu already. Then this next scene had me cackling because guys just get so ticked off when you comment on their pecker so any joke that tells a man he’s 🤏🏻 has me gone ""You better have a massive dick to back up that attitude or else people will be mighty disappointed."" ""Care to bring out a ruler and test your theory?"" ""I left my magnifying glass at home, maybe tomorrow."" Also Zahra purposely messing up the bowling swing he was teaching her just so he could keep touching her... ""Now you try by yourself."" He drags his fingers up my arm again before they disappear. I pout at their loss since he can't see me, I mess up my swing on purpose because I'm petty. ""No, but you were better this time."" He shakes his head and lets out a low laugh. Ah yes, men are such simple creatures, bless them 🥲 As to why I subtracted .75 star? I don't know, I guess it was sort of predictable and I wish the banter and angst lasted longer. For example, Rowan is super insecure by the fact that he's a good artist so he hides that fact from Zahra. When Zahra needs to find someone to illustrate her ideas, Rowan gave Zahra the number of a guy he made up, Scott, and pretended to be him for a while, like at least a month. It was predictable that Zahra was going to be pissed when she found out about Scott actually being Rowan, but it's always fun to watch heroes chase after heroines like puppy dogs so it's both good and bad. Though, after Zahra found out and her and Rowan made up it brought this incredible line ""Just to be clear, should I scream your name or Scott's when you fuck me?"" Oh and you just KNOW he didn't like that at all so she got it damn good. Get that shit girl Anyway, I have nothing else to say peace",4.0,positive,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390
"naur because why the fuck was this book was so good?!?! from the very first page to the last it was a banger. this is the best book i’ve read this year by far!!! it did not fucking miss!! what type of crack shit did the author put into this?!? i was screaming, crying, throwing up, and queefing all while reading this book! now I didn’t think I’d enjoy this book as much as I did. because it’s giving me “Disneyland but for adults.” and grown ass adults obsessed with Disneyland already deserve the most brutal deaths in my opinion. /j…kinda this book not only had my toes curling, lungs empty, and ass smacked but it ate me out from behind like it was judgement day. i had to run laps around the house to calm myself. i tabbed and highlighted so many things like i was gonna be graded for it. if i could give this book the sloppy toppy 3000, i would no questions asked!! this book was the perfect mix of grumpy X sunshine. like it’s the standard at this point. no one has done it better than fucking lauren asher. zahra is just perfect all around. i really saw a lot of myself in her. she’s so confident and strong and kind and overall just a ray of fucking sunshine! she was such a well rounded and deep character. we need more people like zahra. rowan. could fucking get it to say the least. this is the best version of a grumpy fictional character that i’ve read. bro the fucking groveling he does? had me screaming. his whole character development was flawlessly done. the romance, plot, and SMUT were equally parts 10/10! i love that this is the type of book in which SHE falls first but HE falls harder. i loved how their character traits cancelled each other out. how they thaw and breakdown each other’s walls. lauren is so smart for doing that shit. i was up all night read this shit. it’s addictive to say the least. lauren deserves her ass ATE for making this masterpiece ngl. lauren if you’re reading this, which i hope you aren’t, i wish you the world because that’s what you deserve! i hope you go to sleep with both sides of your pillow cold. i hope you find a suitcase filled with money on the streets. i hope you get the best head of your life! i hope you get your ass smacked like a drum like you did mine with this book!",5.0,positive,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390

"The Fine Print ⭐️ This is the most artificial love story I've ever read. The forced connection between the main characters is despicable, literally what is going on. It's giving Wattpad, and that is not a compliment. What is that?! A woman who can talk back to a man?? What a rare occurrence, so much so that she is EXTREMELY interesting... NOT Yeah it's grumpy x sunshine but it sucked. But it was cute a few times. ""Something resembling a rock drops in my stomach. Guilt? Nope. Maybe indigestion"" PlEaSe- 🙂 The writing style reminds me a little bit too much of my economic textbook. Please stop, I don't want to be taken there leave me alone- 🥲 It had very typical romance tropes but again it was so bad. I really needed some romance as I'm currently reading a lot for school at the moment. The AUDACITY of this man to talk absolute shit to her when she's in the hospital??? no because why was my heart breaking on her behalf when I don't even give a fuck about this book? Excuse me I think we got lost in translation- ""She's really done with me, and it's all my fault"" YES YOU LITTLE BITCH GO CRY ABOUT IT TO YOUR MOTHER- OH WAIT SHE'S DEAD 😆 I needed my ruthlessness to shine through when writing this review, because what absolute garbage Booktok made me read.",1.0,negative,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390

"Full of cliches, trashy yet something that keeps you mildly entertained. Plot- 2/5 stars🌟 Spice- 2.5/5🌶️ I honestly don't even know where to start with the review. I apologise in advance cause this borderlines a rant review, tho in my defence it's not my fault. Starting with the central plot- the romance. It's insta love, without the love and without the lust. Weird huh? It's because there is NO CHEMISTRY. None whatsoever, and that stays consistent for about 75% of the book. The little crumbs of chemistry we got is when the two main characters decide to fight for over- you guessed it- nothing! It was forced in their cause of the third act. What's a romance book without any fights? Like please, KMN. Can authors stop doing that? Thank you. They kissed in the first 45 pages so.. Also the sex is so vanilla you would want to skim through it. The side plot- Dreamland park. Now this is where the author gained some points from me. The romance was so bad, that the development of the park seemed much more entertaining to me. The cliches. (Let's count how many there were) 1. The MMC is a billionaire grump that doesn't trust anyone but him. The FMC is an employee with a sunshine personality, who gets along with everyone. 2. FMC is into charity, the billionaire's heart immediately melts. 3. The dialogues are so typical. Expect to see sentences like- I let go of the breath I didn't realise I was holding in. Or How do I do that? You're a smart guy, figure it out. Like dude for once, give the man an idea on what to do. But yeah you get the gist. 4. The billionaire just had to take her on a private jet to NYC, otherwise it won't be a rich guy romance. (That one I'm willing to let go of). 5. The girl falls sick and is rushed to the hospital. Then they go Twilight on it, but MMC actually leaves and causes unnecessary drama. 6. Did I mention the unnecessary drama that HAD to happen, otherwise no one would like it?! 🤦‍♀️ Guys, I didn't even start with the characters yet. FMC- Zahra is presented as the sunshine girl. Everything she does is amazing, people don't see her beyond her smile. Cut it out. Zahra had the personality of a six year old on sugar high, which was highly annoying to read. The author had to write in that the character does charity work in order to get readers to like her. Didn't work with me but okay cool. She didn't contribute much to him, didn't give anything back. MMC- Rowan equally as vanilla as Zahra, but slightly better. He's the typical billionaire grump, won't elaborate on it further. He is however, easier to like. His character arc was handled much better cause of the Dreamland initiative but then the girl got sick and he acted like a douche, so minus points for that. He did try to learn more about Zahra and enjoy the things she does. I did however liked Ani, Zahra's sister. She was full of life and so so easy to like and read about. Claire and Rowan's brothers were there too and that's pretty much about them. One of the things that I liked, except Ani, was the texting interactions between the two main characters. That shined on Rowan's character more. It did bring more colors to the mundane romance. The writing is average, bordering Wattpad style. But there's a lot of potential and room for improvement. I will still read Terms and Conditions, cause I already bought it and I kinda have to. I'm petty and don't want to waste my money, excuse the fact that I already did but yeah... I'm still curious about the author's Dirty Air series- hope that's much better.",2.0,negative,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390

"OK FIRST OF ALL: y'all do such a shitty job at advertising books, this should be illegal. What's the point of saying: I am a bookstagrammer when you DON'T DISCLOSE important information? This book is a Walt Disney's grandson fanfic. The most important disclaimer of all: If you are NOT A DISNEY ADULT, this book is NOT FOR YOU. You just got VERY lucky that I happen to be A DISNEY adult otherwise this book would have been ripped to shreds. I just came into this with the right set of expectations. Even though NO ONE SAID THIS WAS A DISNEY fanfic basically. I feel like most of the mixed reviews can be avoided if you know how to recommend a book, so here I am doing everyone's jobs. Anyways, lazy recommendation aside...I came into this with the right set of expectations because I knew this was a romcom. Basically, the main character Rowan is Walt Disney's grandson. He has 2 other brothers, Walt Disney dies but he leaves behind a letter, he won't let the boys take over the company and the park together it if they don't meet certain requirements he made on that letter. The boys lost their mom and hate their dad, if they don't meet those requirements, their dad will get the majority of the shares and they don't want that. Rowan used to be very creative, so grandpa wants him to find that side of himself again, one of the brothers is a womanizer so he has to get married and have kids, and the other is an ADHD kid, who fucks shit up all the time and I can't really remember exactly what was his thing. This is also a GRUMPY-SUNSHINE book. They are my least favorite, but I actually enjoyed how this was written. The sunshine main character was way less annoying than I thought she would be. We also get some amazing down syndrome representation in this book, since the FMC's sister has down syndrome. You also get to see a soulless capitalist man turn into a socialist, a guy who cares about his employees, because of pussy but still... it's a pretty big step. This is VERY similar to the hating game and the love hypothesis, if you loved those, you are going to enjoy this. The sunshine character works under Rowan, so you also get somewhat of an office/authority relationship scenario. Honestly, this was spicier than the love hypothesis and the hating game combined, we get 3-4 amazing sex scenes, they are pretty explicit as well. The dirty talk was awesome and not cringy at all. Rowan exudes BDE and I liked the way he talked to her. This was a cookie cutter romcom that fit every box, it was emotional, romantic, there's some miscommunication trope (twice to 3 times), sex after 60%, a little bit of a slow-burn and a happy ending. The writing was great and I had a great time. 4/5 Now that I read back on my review I feel like I need to make something clear: when I say Disney adult, I mean DISNEY PARK adult.

"Now, I was expecting something average, because the reviews for this series are a mixed bag. And if a book is hyped on BookTok, it’s kind of a red flag for me. But I still wanted to give this series a try. So I went in with the lowest of low of expectations. So imagine my surprise when I find myself enjoying this book? I honestly had such a good time with this story. I was flying through it and it felt like something my mind needed. These idiots were so cute together! I really liked their romance. I mean, it isn’t anything groundbreaking or new when it comes to the romance genre but does it need to be? Not necessarily. The enjoyment factor was pretty high. All thanks to Rowan and his grumpy facade. I just find pleasure in seeing men like him, who are so stoic and guarded, crumble. And crumble he did. 🫠 He’s just a wounded boy inside. 🤧 I don’t need my characters, heroes in particular, to always be emotionally equipped to handle their feelings. I enjoy them feeling stunted for a while and it’s nice to see and go on that journey of growth with them. Some parts of this felt cheesy and cliche, the writing was okay, at times it felt like I had to suspend my disbelief. But maybe it only felt like that because I’m not rich? 🥲 But I’m happy for me.

I wanted to slam my head against the wall, especially when they got together, that was the stupidest thing I have read. there was absolutely zero chemistry after they got together and it was as if they were forcing themselves SO HARD to feel a ounce of affection or want for one another. the plot was reasonably enjoyable BUT we only got like two pages worth of it😭. zahra was a caricature, like there is no way anyone can convince me she acts like a real person, I had a love-hate relationship with her because as much as I enjoyed reading about her occasionally, she annoyed me and made me cringe so so so so so so badly more than I liked her. but a positive is.... that I didn't hate her? rowan on the other hand, might have been one of the worst characters I have read about recently because he's quite literally a child masquerading as a misunderstood, mean and cold man. he was so annoying and everything he did and thought was so contradictory. nothing about him made any sense? and his personality was also nonexistent??? also all of his ""grand"" gestures were so exaggerated and I just didn't believe them. I don't know how else to explain it other than it just seemed SO fake. and I am not a fan of insta-love, so I didn't like that either, but that's just a personal preference. so now let's get specific into why I didn't like rowan or their relationship!! (!!SPOILERS!!) ➛ ❝Hurting her was the last thing I wanted to do, but it’s necessary. Loving her isn’t an option. I have too much at stake and not enough flexibility to have her and the lifestyle I’ve spent my entire life pursuing.❞ ""but it's necessary"" 🤓🐺 LMAOOO like are you serious? you are not in the middle of a life and death mission in which you HAVE to do this to save her and everyone else in the world?? all this talk about love not being an option and having too much at stake is insane. there is literally NOTHING at stake HELPPPPP😭 his company, money, status, theme park, LITERALLY EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE????????? ➛ ❝Zahra, hear me out. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I’m stuck in a constant state of nausea and heartburn, no matter what I eat.” “Sounds like you can feel after all.” She scowls. “Yes. Are you happy? I feel like shit, ever since I left you in that damn hospital room, knowing full well you were crying because of me.❞ HE BROKE UP WITH HER AND PRETENDED THAT HE WAS DOING ALL OF THIS JUST TO ""PASS THE TIME"" BEFORE HE HAD TO GO BACK TO HIS RICH LIFE IN CHICAGO. someone explain to me why he is yelling at her and trying to blame her for not being able to sleep, eat and for feeling shitty🥺🥺🥺 like that's all you!!! ➛ ❝She’s dismissing me. I’ve never felt so…awful.❞ and I've never felt so great? this was literally the only point in the book where I was smiling and enjoying it. says a lot... ➛ ❝Since everything is settled with the Director position, I can use it as a bargaining chip to show her my good faith.❞ USE IT AS A BARGAINING CHIP??? TO GET HER BACK??????????????? she's not an arcade game where you buy more tokens to keep playing until you win a prize. she's literally a person? with her own mind, feelings, and choices?????? like someone tell him to stop being naturally manipulative. he's treating love AND her as a transaction. ➛ ❝Cut the bullshit, Rowan. What’s your problem?” His eyebrows rise at my tone. “You want to know what’s my problem?” I nod. “You. This whole damn situation.” He throws his arms out in my general direction. My muscles lock up. “What do you mean?” “We were supposed to be something casual. Something fun. This isn’t even close to what I want or need in my life. I have a company to run, a park to oversee, and a lot of shit to work through. People are depending on me, and I’m stuck making sure you’re okay because I feel responsible.❞ keep in mind she's in the hospital after being passed out for like three days after she's hit her head and was insanely sick. and he's dropping this bomb on her as soon as she woke up IN THE HOSPITAL BED. he said he's ""stuck"" looking after her and he's listing a bunch of other things and making them seem as if they are more important to him than she is. and when he's trying to win her back, he's surprised that she doesn't believe a word that comes out of his mouth?????? I'm surprised he's that stupid. ➛ ❝He shuts his eyes. “I’ve lost track of what’s important.” And you’re not it. He doesn’t need to say it, but it’s written all over his face.❞ like?? ➛ ❝ No. It’s yours because you’re a big baby who can’t admit you like her.” I can’t hold back my sad laugh. “If only life was that simple.” “You told me excuses are for losers.❞ thank you ani for literally eating him up🙏 another thing, is that I decided to read the extended epilogue which was the most pointless, worthless, stupidest thing to have ever existed. like ever. I hope the rest of the series is better but... I'm not getting my hopes up😭😭😭 __________________________________ __________________________________ ·˚ ༘·: ̗̀➛ pre-read: the way everyone in this entire world has read this book is crazy! so I guess it's finally time. ⋆.𖥔⋆˚ ̗̀─▸ buddy read with !!! so excited 🫶",1.0,negative,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390
"So unpopular opinion but: I didn’t really like it . I’m sorry to disappoint all the lovely people who were the reason for my reading this .I don’t know if it’s just me but here are some of the things that didn’t do it for me : 1) Firstly Rowan , the love interest and pov no 2. To be plain , I just didn’t like him and once you don’t like or respect the main characters then that’s it for the book I guess . He was cold , rude , presumptuous and arrogant (not in the normal sense either )He was a JERK . Zara had this to say while they were together: “ A man willing to do anything to get what he wants . Selfish.controlling . An angry man with secret smiles and soft laughs and a golden heart he keeps hidden from the world” Mmmmmm nope . 2) Insta-love . Oh how I HATE insta love . Their relationship seemed so forced and this “the feeling spread to my cock” bs that Rowan pulls like EVERY chapter since he SAW her .plus they got together too fast , I like myself a slow burn especially considering the banter and jokes were the best part of the book. Zero romance? Like what is this ?: his body tightened “if you tell anyone, I’ll have to-“ “Yeah yeah , fire me . I got it already” “I’ll have to fuck you” How verrrrry romantic indeed 3) boredom . Never at any point in this book was I interested . Was Bored throughout . DNF’d this book . Whatever it was supposed to focus on passed and the book just continued and diverged from that path without my noticing . I was left looking for the climax and purpose .gave up looking . 4) the drama ? Idk this book just annoyed me . I could tell which moments I was supposed to swoon and go “awwww” but that’s not what happened . It felt immature for some reason and the writing style was so off . I don’t know if it was just too formal but it was evidently bad .There was a whole lot of cringe and eye roll moments 5) At first I really liked Zara . I could really relate to her in some ways . Overly playful and joking all the time , constantly blushing ….then when she refused to take his bs …..until she did .Listen I know the guy has daddy issues (basic btw) we get it . we’re sorry but we canNOT use that to justify his behavior ?! There are people who have gone through much worse and still have DECENCY. After a while she got a littttle annoying with the way she kept making excuses for him and behaving like an idiot . “you really do like me” she bats her long lashes 6) I know books aren’t meant to be realistic but cmon . Your trying to tell me out of all the people there Zara was the ONLY good creator ? Please make it make sense . Likes: almost nothing except for her sister and her sisters boyfriend plus the Jane Austen references. In the beginning it was pretty funny and I was happy , it’s a real shame . Overall I would totally pay for a video taken of of me while reading this book . It would be so full of expressions : mainly annoyance , repulsion and disbelief . Sorry for the quick , poor review writing . Somebody is supposed to focusing on their approaching exams",,,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)",74045390
