"This lovely mystery book is first and foremost about the administration of the long-overdue justice, right? At least that's what the mastermind behind it all believes. But the question is - who has the right to decide what justice is? And who is to decide what punishment serves the crime? And is perceived justice at all costs the ultimate goal, or is it the frequently pointless work of a maniac? As a matter of fact, what is justice after all? I think the story of this book ( ) is familiar to most readers. It is a lovely and fascinating idea. Ten people are lured onto a remote island under false pretenses just to realize that they are all about to be punished by death for the 'crimes' that they have committed in the past and have gotten away with. Killed in a manner predicted by a silly yet ominous children's poem with the conclusion of ""... and then there were none"" . What's more, they come to realize that the mastermind - or maniac? - has to be among them. And the (very polite, in the traditional British way) game of survival begins, complete with all the necessary societal rituals¹ and classism² that are not disposed of even under the threat of imminent demise. ¹The politeness and overt show of respect to one another even in the face of imminent murder by someone in their midst - because, of course, you would not want to offend anyone. Continuing to socialize and take meals together. Insisting on chivalry when a woman could be the murderer just as well as a man - these are just some of the examples. ² Just think of everyone expecting the impeccable service by the butler even though HIS WIFE JUST DIED! Everyone deciding to stick together and be careful - but never including the servants in it. The belief by some that people of 'proper class' would be incapable of murder. The list can go on and on. And all of these assumptions prove to be wrong. And as, despite the precautions, the number of people trapped on the island continues to decline, the uneasy tension sets in, and the impeccable facades begin to crack. "" The oth­ers went up­stairs, a slow unwilling pro­ces­sion. If this had been an old house, with creak­ing wood, and dark shad­ows, and heav­ily pan­elled walls, there might have been an eerie feel­ing. But this house was the essence of moder­ni­ty. There were no dark corners - ​no possi­ble slid­ing pan­els - it was flood­ed with elec­tric light - everything was new and bright and shining. There was nothing hid­den in this house, noth­ing con­cealed. It had no at­mo­sphere about it. Some­how, that was the most fright­en­ing thing of all. They ex­changed good-​nights on the up­per land­ing. Each of them went in­to his or her own room, and each of them automatical­ly, al­most with­out con­scious thought, locked the door. "" The story is captivating and very smart, and the ending had me baffled for a bit the first time I read it. It has a neat resolution despite an obvious plot hole (but hey, it doesn’t bother me that much). It's an enjoyable read to say the least. But what made me unsettled both of the times I read it was the nagging question of justice, as I mentioned above. Yes, on one hand, it's almost poetic justice to punish the criminals who thought they got away with it. On the other hand, is eye-for-an-eye the best way to get even? And who's to judge, anyway? Who is either conceited enough or deranged enough to assume that he has the right and the moral authority to determine guilt and the extent of punishment just like that? Don't get me wrong - the people accused on the island are undeniably guilty (even though it's not necessarily murder as we think of for some of them - Vera Claythorne is really guilty of neglect, albeit with a desire to kill, and Emily Brent is pretty much guilty of being a judgmental über-righteous heartless prude) . But the degree of their guilt varies quite significantly in my perception, and it does not always coincide with what their 'unknown' judge/executioner thinks (running two children over with a car and feeling no remorse is to me worse than firing a pregnant servant who then goes on to kill herself, for instance) . And is arbitrarily and single-handedly determining their guilt and doling out punishments not just as much (or even much worse) or a crime than they have committed? Conceited, self-righteous crime? Decide for yourself. Speaking of guilt - this novel has quite a bit to say on this subject. You see, many of the characters have already been judged and condemned by their own selves. Vera Claythorne and General Macarthur both are tormented by their guilt, and at least one of them become a direct victim of it. Interestingly, others, no less guilty, are not tormented by their conscience at all. But ultimately this does not matter at all for their survival; only the fact that they were deemed guilty. So should being tormented by guilt versus a cold-blooded killer factor at all in the administration of justice? These are the thoughts that kept running through my head as I was reading this excellent non-traditional critically-acclaimed specimen of mystery literature. And therefore bravo to Miss Christie for making me think and care - and not just mindlessly flipping pages to get to the bottom of the whodunit. Because 'WHO' was much less important to me than 'HOW' and 'WHY' - especially 'WHY' . For all of this, I give it the unflinching guilt-free 4 stars. —————— Also posted on .",4.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"There is scarcely any comfort to be found in this book; only an indelible, arcane horror. And Then There Were None was uncomfortable as it lodged itself in the darkest corner of my mind. The questions it asks, the implications it conceals, are soul-curdling and unforgettable. In short, I liked this book, but it's not exactly an experience I’m keen on revisiting. ** In Agatha Christie’s nightmarish tableau of a novel, ten people are summoned as house guests to a remote island by a Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen. The guests assembled trade stiff dialogue over dinner and cocktails while musing about the celebrity of the island and puzzling about their hosts’ tardiness. The whimsy of the moment, however, abruptly disappears when a disembodied message blaring from a gramophone tallies, in vivid and mordant detail, the guests' unpunished crimes. What begins as astonishment quickly turns into horror when, shortly after, the house's occupants embark on the ghastly business of being murdered, one by one, per the instructions of a horrid nursery rhyme. Death runs rampant with its bloody scythe on Soldier Island: this is their sentence coming to retrieve them at last. “Be sure thy sin will find thee out.” Agatha Christie, an extraordinarily good writer, digs with bright horrible relish into this exhilarating, unsettling, and brilliantly constructed story. She plays the reader with the delicacy of an expert angler, scarcely allowing us a moment to dig in our heels and stop where we are, just for a while, just long enough to get a better idea of what’s ahead. The experience of reading this novel is, as a result, sometimes akin to walking through a nightmare, unable to orient one's self, understanding very little beyond the deep-seated sense of being utterly afraid . This is intensified by the hermetic and creepy atmosphere of Soldier Island, and the slow unraveling of each of the characters' haunting pasts. What appears at first, however, to be a thriller is something far more dangerous in Christie's hands. The surface is arresting, but the harder you think the further you go, and the story keeps on getting more productive. And Then There Were None is infused with psychological depth that holds its own fascination. What are we capable of doing, asks the novel, when fear, fractured and wild, takes hold of us and scours out all else? What lengths are we willing to go to escape accountability, and purge memories of our most torturous evils? Each of the character becomes a mirror from which there’s no escape, reflecting their monstrosity back at each other on and on and on. In that sense, this novel is an invitation to take a long, hard look at one’s own self in the mirror that dares us not to flinch. And Then There Were None is, furthermore, a compelling portrait of a psychopath who suffers an unconquerable confederation of self-righteousness and depravity. But what is most frightening is not the depth of their evil, but how cold it runs. Are humans really capable of being this infatuated with the theatrics of murder? None of these characters are, of course, the kind of people you would want to roll the red carpet for, but does anyone really deserve this? “Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.” If there's a flaw running through And Then There Were None , it's that Christie maintains a respectful distance from her characters, and at times, that distance runs toward dryness. I think a bit more poison in the pen would have helped in drawing out the characters, some of whom don’t entirely step into the page before... they start dropping like flies. Overall, however, And Then There Were None is a highly engaging murder mystery and a provocative, pitch-black psychological thriller that will be hard to forget for many.",4.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"The story goes a bit like this: 10 strangers each get invitations from someone they think they know to stay on an island resort. Hells yeah! Sunshine & sea air! Well, resort is a bit of a misnomer. It's really a big house on an island. Still, it's famous for being a party place, and nobody in the group turns it down. BIG MISTAKE. Almost as soon as everyone is gathered together, a recorded voice booms out through the walls and accuses each of them of being a murderer. And not just...YOU'RE ALL MURDERERS! Nope, whoever it is appears to know specific details about each death, and why these particular people were responsible. Of course, everyone immediately starts proclaiming their innocence! Wha..? Noooo! That person died accidentally! I was never even a suspect! Who dares...?! Harrumph & bluster! However, within minutes one of them falls over dead. Suicide? Or something more nefarious?! As the body count rises, they have to face the fact that these aren't accidents. And with each new death coinciding with a children's rhyme that's tacked up in each room, all signs point to a self-appointed executioner in their midst. After they get organized and take a peek around, they realize that they are quite alone on this island. Their mysterious benefactor must be disguised as one of the guests, and is more than likely...the murderer. Dum, dum, duuuuum! The tension ratchets up with each body, and the guests start turning on each other in an attempt to ferret out the killer. Eventually, they decide they just need to calm down and survive till the police can get to the island. Good plan, right? But what if there isn't anyone left to tell the cops what happened? So whodunit? I ain't tellin'. Psst. The epilogue is really important. 2023 I just listened to the BBC Radio Dramatization of this book. Wow! Well done! I would always suggest that you read or listen to the actual book beforehand, but this was really a wonderful adaptation of it for fans of Christie's story. Highly recommended if you get the chance.",4.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"i want to start off by saying if i had been alive in 1939 and read this when it was first published, i would have given this 5 stars. without a doubt. theres a reason this story is one of the best-selling books of all time - the concept paved the way for the 'whodunnit' mysteries of today. i would have been riveted by this story. that being said, because the influence of this book is so far-reaching, it didnt feel like it was new. ive read this format in many other novels and seen it in many films. this isnt the books fault - its just an unfortunate consequence of exposure. i also am not a fan of ACs writing style. it feels so sterile to me. yes, the characters and facts are presented in a very straight-forward way and its very easy to follow along, but the lack of descriptive narration just isnt my style. i also feel like all of the characters are carbon copies of each other - i was constantly confusing them because there is no personalisation to their characterisation. i do like the concept and can appreciate the phenomenal influence this story has had on modern writing, but the execution prevented me from loving this entirely. ↠ 3 stars",3.0,neutral,And Then There Were None,16159005
"I'm a big lover of Agatha Christie, she has written some fantastic murder mysteries and her stories never get tiring. But this is the one that just comes out on top every time. It partly, and quite amusingly, reminds me of that old American murder mystery in Sunset Beach. Basically, they're the only ones on this island and someone is killing them off one by one in accordance with the Ten Little Indians rhyme . And I swear I never saw it coming, and I'm usually very good at it. It's just a very clever novel, full of mystery and suspense and easily quite frightening at times. I like how Agatha Christie doesn't have to write a 500 page novel with a massive back story, her mysteries are very simply put together but always clever and hard to decipher. I would recommend this book to everyone.",5.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005

"is one of Agatha Christie's most celebrated mystery novels, and purportedly one of the most difficult for her to write. I don't dislike this book. It seems to be a favorite among many, but it's very middle of the road for me as far as Mystery/Thriller books go. The Good: I enjoy the setup & how this mystery is structured. It's fun & easy to engage with in a ""Gee, I sure am glad I'm not in their shoes"" kind of way. It's written well with an accurate insight on human desperation & how psychosomatic effects can drastically warp one's sense of control. The length (only 264 pages) & pacing of this novel is very appropriate. It gives adequate page space to the mystery & the characters, acquainting the reader quickly with the situation so that we can dive straight into the action. The Bad: I did not care about even one of these characters past seeing the creative ways the author would kill them off. They're developed & believable as people, but I never felt any type of connection or sympathy which I think can be quite important in a story like this. Sometimes the characters don't matter or can get away with being stereotypical cardboard cutouts, but that tends to shift the over into the torture porn arena & I don't believe for a second that is where Christie's book belongs. Probably the most disappointing part of my experience, I was not impressed with the conclusion of this mystery. Right off the bat, I didn't feel engaged with the actual solving of the problem because it felt as though I was kept at an arm's length from any of the potential clues. Call me an idiot, maybe this was obvious for other people? But I genuinely don't feel as though readers are given a chance to make even an a semi-educated guess about who the perpetrator is. It relies wholly on the very, very last section of the book to lay out the details for what they are & explain the unknown bits. It's very: ""Oh, by the way here's what happened."" Anti-climactic to say the least. When I'm reading a Mystery/Thriller, I want to feel as though I'm being challenged to figure out what's happening before the characters do. I'll be the first to admit I almost never guess the truth in its entirety, but that's beside the point. I was to the point where I was almost ready to believe something supernatural was happening. Not a great sign. When the truth is finally exposed, I had a hard time feeling as startled as I'm meant to feel because I've seen this story before in popular media. Now, this came out in the 1930's and so this isn't by any means the fault of the book itself. It probably came first in every instance I'm thinking of. But as a modern reader this didn't pack the same punch it might have if I were a reader of the 1930's. Anyhow, that's another classic under the belt!",3.0,neutral,And Then There Were None,16159005
"Is there anyone on Earth who really needs my review of this book? I mean...it's probably the most well-known mystery of all time that wasn't at some point adapted into a BBC miniseries starring a Slenderman-like monstrous human who haunts my nightmares. Either you've already read this or you're never going to. If you somehow exist in the in-between, here you go: This is a good and satisfying story and it's fun. That's all there is to it.

I'm annoying even myself. ------------- pre-review okay. the hype is warranted. review to come / 3.5 or 4 stars ------------- currently-reading updates for a long time i thought i'd already read this book, and then i remembered that i had simply borne witness to a play version of it that was being performed in the acting elective i took in my freshman year of high school. so not quite the same.",4.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005

"5 stars to 's . This is the book that started my absolute love of the mystery genre. I was addicted and must have read it 3 or 4 times over the course of the year. Between the poem, the deserted island, the plot twist, the count-down, the pure clandestine suspense... it couldn't get any better. Story Ten people receive a mystery letter from someone they don't know that indicates they should come to a remote island. Why would they go????? After arriving, they try to figure out the connection between all of them while waiting for their mysterious host. After coming across a cute little poem about how ten little indians die, they decide they will wait it out until the next morning when the ferry comes back to take them home. But it will never come! Each guest suddenly dies matching the line from the poem... resulting in alliances and mistrust. Pure fun. In a masterful conclusion, the reader understands all the connections, learns why the killer chose them to die and develops a very distinct opinion on who was right and who was wrong in this story. Amazing! Strengths 1. Plot - can you get any better than telling the reader that 10 people will die and then guessing the order and the weapon? 2. Characters - All walks of life, all personalities. You'll love some and hate some! Weaknesses 1. Only that there wasn't a follow-up... Final Thoughts If you are a mystery fan, you must read this. If you've never read Agatha Christie, this must be your first - before you tackle Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot.

"This one's a classic; nearly everyone—reader or watcher—will have seen a piece of media inspired by it (in fact, we only recently rewatched Clue here in Stiefvaterland). Supposedly it is the world's best-selling mystery. I expected it to be dated (originally published in 1939 with an eye-buggingly problematic title), and the details were, of course, but the structure was as elegant and modern as anything you might hope to find today. It's a sparse, wicked thought exercise. With ten main characters, it's also a masterclass in juggling reader attention; Christie takes very little time in making sure we can easily tell them all apart. Christie wrote: ""I don't say it is the play or book of mine that I like best, or even that I think it is my best, but I do think in some ways that it is a better piece of craftsmanship than anything else I have written.""

"One of the worlds best selling books of all time, Agatha Christie's ""and Then There Were None"" sets the standard for crime fiction. The book was first published under a different title in jolly old England, but even back in 1939 American publishers were far too politically correct to use a title they found so offensive. Still again, in 1964 and again in 1986 a third title was published but political correctness struck again. I read the book under the authors original title because I wanted to read it as she intended it. The book has inspired radio broadcast, stage adaptations, television mini series, several movies, board and video games. As the 1939 story begins, 8 unacquainted guest have been invited to a very large home on an isolated island off the coast of England for a type of holiday. When the water ferry drops them off they find their host has not yet arrived but there are two staff members there to meet their needs. Soon it is brought to their attention that all 8 guest along with the 2 staff members are accused of various murders from their past. Then the first of the guest drops dead. By the next morning another of the remaining 9 is found dead. There is surely a murderer on the island and as the story continues to unfold the reader is never given any information other than that which the guest may encounter. I didn't figure out who done it.

A couple of my friends have been reading Agatha Christie books and seeing their reviews stirred an interest in them because I've never read Agatha Christie before.

"A masterclass in locked room mysteries from the Queen of Crime, Agatha Christie. ""It was my ambition to invent a murder that no one could solve …….... I determined to commit not one murder, but murder on a grand scale"". On Soldier Island the deaths of the ten visitors coincides with the famous nursery rhyme ‘Ten Little Soldiers’, until ""one little soldier boy was left all alone; he went and hanged himself and then there were none"" . Intense, oh so clever, and gripping. The Plot I can provide a few insights to this book without spoiling the plot, the ultimate twist at the end, and the rationale. It is that good and brilliantly conceived. For example, we know from the book title, that the killing spree continued over a few nights until there were ‘none’. In addition, all the guests were brought to the island sharing two things in common. First of all, they had all caused the death of someone else which is then revealed in front of the other guests, on the first night. All this using a gramophone message - I love it. Secondly none of them had ever been found guilty of the crimes they committed. In some cases, it wasn’t even obvious that a crime had been committed at all. So how did the killer assemble these guests? none of whom knew each other, except the ‘Rogers’, a husband and wife team. Invited by U.N Owen, cleverly disguising the fictious name ‘Unknown’ the killing spree starts with the death of Tony Marston who dies of cyanide poisoning after finishing his drink. His death is then followed by the death of the housekeeper, Mrs Rogers. As suspicion grows among the remaining eight people, more deaths occur even under the watchful eye of those 'trapped'. And in true Agatha Christie style everyone is portrayed at the potential killer. Afterall, they have all killed someone already!!! Review and Comments I will start with the great characterisation and the ten people stranded at Soldier Island. Whilst we don’t have an in-depth view of every character there is enough of the personality to make this such a great cast. They are all so different and relevant for the characteristics they exhibit. Ten in total which may sound like a daunting number to follow through the story. I did it by their job title not their name!!! (Doctor, Housekeeper, Judge, and the General, to name but a few) and so could keep track easily enough plus we have effective signposting throughout if you lose a few before their time!!!. The setting is wonderful. The island escape, and then stranded with no transport to flee. Although this has been done many times since, when it works it is superb. If this had been an old house with creaking wood, and dark shadows, and heavily panelled walls there might have been more obvious signs for its new inhabitants that they were part of a murderous plot to even the scales of justice. But there were no dark corners. The house was the essence of modernity. As AC says about the house ‘There was nothing hidden. Nothing concealed. It had no atmosphere about it’…. Somehow this was the most frightening thing of all. If there is such a thing as the perfect crime novel, then this is it. A timeless book that set the bar extremely high in the ‘locked room mystery’ subgenre. We have symbolism and clues everywhere. The most illogical logical puzzle where the reader can do nothing else but laud the plot twists, red herrings, and skillfully cunning plot that is meticulously planned. A very very clever book.",5.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"I’m usually that annoying person who smugly predicts whodunnit by chapter three, no matter whether it’s a psychological thriller or a murder mystery. It’s why mysteries and thrillers and I have an on-and-off relationship, I’m tired of clocking the formula. But then I decided to go toe-to-toe with And Then There Were None—and a special edition, no less, where you get to lock in your guess before unlocking the final chapter. Oh , I thought, how cute. Agatha, prepare to be outsmarted. First guess? I thought I had it dialled. But Christie cackled in my face from her grave and spun me in circles. Safe to say, this isn’t just any murder mystery, it’s a masterclass in misdirection. With each chapter, Agatha crescendoed the tension and suspense, leaving me whispering, “I didn’t see that coming.” Consider my “always guesses the twist/whodunnit” ego officially humbled. If you haven’t picked up Christie and you think you’re some kind of sleuthing genius, grab this edition. Consider it a reality check. My thanks to NetGalley & HarperCollins UK, HarperFiction for the digital copy in exchange for an honest review! Looks like it's available to read now on Kindle Unlimited. 🔹🔹🔹 Taking it as my sign from the universe to finally check out Agatha Christie.",5.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005

"$1.99 Kindle sale, July 29, 2020! If you've never read one of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries, this one is my favorite! Every once in a while on Goodreads I find myself feeling compelled to make a True Confession, and here's another one: I'm not all that much of a Hercule Poirot fan. For someone who's read probably 30 or 40 Agatha Christie books over her lifetime, that's probably an odd thing. I like him okay, I don't DISlike him, but yeah, he kind of irks me sometimes. So when I'm picking up an Agatha Christie mystery, I'm always a little bit tickled when it doesn't involve Poirot. This is one of those books, so it already had a leg up on the competition when I started it. And here's the other thing: with all the Christie books I've read in my lifetime, there are only a handful that I've found really memorable. This, again, is one of those books. In fact, plotwise I would say it's my favorite Christie book of all time. Many Christie fans consider it her masterpiece. Eight very different people are invited to an isolated island off the coast of England. Fairly soon it becomes apparent that they all have one thing in common: they've all been accused of murder but were never convicted or brought to justice. Each person has gotten a written invitation to the island, tailored to their needs or situation, like a job offer or a holiday invitation, most of the invitations coming from someone they don't know who signs the invites as U.N. Owen. Together with the butler and cook who are already on the island, there are ten people. They gather for drinks and to meet their U.N.Known host. While they are waiting, a few things happen: 1. They notice a framed copy of the nursery rhyme ""Ten Little Indians"" hanging on the wall, in which the Indians* leave, die or disappear one by one, until there are none. There are also ten Indian figurines on the dining room table. 2. Mysteriously, a recorded voice begins to speak, describing each of the characters in turn and accusing them each of committing murder but evading justice . . . until now. 3. One of the guests laughs off the shock and quickly downs a drink. And immediately chokes and dies. One of the ten figurines is soon discovered to be broken, and the nursery rhyme reflects his manner of death (""One choked his little self and then there were nine""). So begins an intense tale, as the guests frantically try to protect themselves and figure out which of them is the killer (or is it someone else hiding on the island?) before they are all dead. And at the same time, they're all dealing with their own feelings of guilt to varying degrees. And the figurines keep disappearing--DUN! DUN! DUN! The psychological exploration in this book is great, beyond anything I recall reading in any other Christie mystery, and the reveal at the end completely surprised me. * Content note: For the record, some readers may have qualms with this nearly 80-year-old novel's dicey history of racial slurs and insensitivity. It was originally actually titled Ten Little Niggers , based on the British version of this poem, which apparently wasn't considered offensive enough not to use in England when the book was first published in 1939. For the American edition of the book, it was changed to ""Ten Little Indians"" and, later, ""And Then There Were None"" (which is the version I have, but still with the Indian poem and figurines) - better but still not great. I understand that many recent editions now use ten little soldiers for the poem.",5.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"This year I have decided to take part in a women's century challenge in the group catching up on classics where the participants read a book written in ten consecutive decades. I chose to focus on the 20th century and my 1930s selection is And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. Although I had previously read some of her Hercule Poirot cases, this is my first stand alone mystery of Christie's that I have read. A suspenseful premise for a case, And Then There Were None left me on edge for the duration of the book. Ten individuals who committed murder at one point in their lives have been invited to Soldier Island for a supposed holiday. Upon arrival, the participants note the quaintness of the island and the home which they are staying in. Yet, on top of the mantel in each bedroom is the poem ""ten little Indians"". In the communal dining room are ten salt shakers each representing a person and the same poem. As the group gathers for cocktail hour, a gramophone recording announces the crime each individual is guilty of committing. Shocked at first, each person comes to terms with the accusation and reveals what really happened to the group. Christie's participants represent a cross section of society including a judge, doctor, Scotland Yard police officer, retired general, mercenary, governess, and spinster. None of these primary participants believes themselves guilty of the crime because after all they were acquitted. Yet one of their party believes them all to be guilty, or they would not have been invited to Soldier Island. One by one the group is murdered, the island is searched, and the dwindling group realizes that there is a murderer in their midst. The death mirrors the poem on the wall, and as each person is killed, another salt shaker breaks. It is up to the remaining people to identify the murder. Unlike Hercule Poirot cases where Christie allows the reader to crack the case early on only to have Poirot peal back layers and layers to the case, in And Then There Were None, Dame Christie does not clue us as to who the murderer is. Even someone as myself who reads a fair number of mysteries was left captivated as to whodunit, allowing me to read quickly until the end of the book. The participants were also held in suspense, accusing each other of being the murderer. This lead to a revealing denouement, one that had me guessing until the last page. I have read many mysteries written by women, including many cases starring female private eyes and police detectives. Many of these mystery writers have Dame Agatha Christie to thank for paving their way as early as the 1920s. And Then There Were None first appeared in serial form, leaving its readers in suspense until the next installment appeared. A captivating mystery, I am open to reading more of Christie's stand alone cases, and rate this mystery 4 stars.",4.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005

"Extraordinary and gripping novel! I knew that the best way to start reading the literary work by Agatha Christie was choosing her most known book. And There were none is the best-selling mystery novel of all time with 100 million of copies, and the fifth book in the list comprehending all genres. That is something to give to Agatha Christie the respect that she deserves. Initially this novel on UK was titled Ten Little Niggers , only because the original nursery rhyme was called that but it was obviously seen as racist, then in USA was decided to change the title to Ten Little Indians , but again obviously as seen as racist again, so at the end the title was changed to And There were none , and the nursery rhyme inside the book was changed to ""Ten Little Soldiers"", curiously enough none member of any army so far as pointed out as racist that final change. I mean, the title was just because a widely known nursery rhyme and none character on the book was afro-american or native-american. To this, I want to comment that it's lucky that not many children would had more nightmares since a lot of nursery rhymes have truly scary lyrics. No wonder in stuff like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Saphire and Steel were used nursery rhymes with truly scary effects. Returning to the novel, it was a remarkable reading. Great atmosphere where you feel as trapped as those people on that island. I want to comment that at some point I figured it out who was the murderer, don't worry, I won't tell it, and I have no doubt that some would say: ""Oh, sure! I believe you Sherlock!"". However I do indeed discovered it. This is not my first mystery story. I have read several books in the genre and I have watched a lot of TV shows like Murder, She Wrote , Columbo , Criminal Minds , CSI: Miami , etc... And while that doesn't turn me into a detective, in my defense, I knew who was only because I focused on the ""why"" and not the ""how"" that certainly I didn't know that. You can say that I did an amateur criminal profile and that helped me to have a suspect of my own that it resulted true. Also, I had some advantage for being Spanish speaking since there is a clue that only can be detected due that not matter that I read the novel on English, but taking in account the very detail that it's indeed a printed novel, I catched something and putting together some clues. Well, I figured it out. Believe or not. It doesn't matter. Anyway, I think that many of the fun of reading this kind of mystery novels is trying to figure out the culprit during the process of reading the book. Not matter if you guess right or not, always it's rewarding when the mystery is explained. A delicious way to make your neurons to exercise. Again, knowing who was, or at least thinking that I knew who was, since obviously I couldn't confirm it until reading the whole book, it didn't help me to know how everything was made until it was explained on the novel. Definitely, Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery! Certainly, this novel isn't only a marvellous detective mystery book but also a truly scary horror story. Priceless setting for a scenario and fantastic twisted character developing. Appendix: (July 23rd, 2014) The clue that I found thanks that I am a born Spanish-language speaker: WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! Read ONLY if you already read the novel, since this is a mega-spoiler telling who the culprit is! I seldom put spoilers in my reviews, but I wrote this appendix basically since I was contacted by several readers asking me about the ""big clue"" and well, while I don't mind to share it, well, also I don't want to find out later that it was written down in some other review as theirs, taking in account that it seems that only me were the one who noticed that. Ok, the big fuzz about the clue that I found is that the first character that you find in the novel is Mr. Justice Wargrave on the chapter one, you may say: ""So what?"", well, the mysterious couple who invited to all guests, the initials of both names of them are U.N.O., in the imaginary woman is ""Una Nancy Owen"" and the supposed husband is ""U.N. Owen. U.N.O. that in Spanish can be spelled just like ""uno"" which means ""one"" on English. Maybe that a coincidence, but with Agatha Christie nothing can be left to chance, so I think that may be a clue targeted to the readers with knowledge about Spanish language.",5.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"I’m someone who spoils book reviews pretty easily (without even realising), so when it comes to reviewing crime and mystery novels I have to be super careful - not giving too much away. Honestly, crime and mystery novels aren’t really my thing; but as a book lover, it feels like you really have to have at least read 1 Agatha Christie ’s work. After finishing this book, what I gotta say is: this is mystery at its finest. The motives, the big picture, the tricks, and the settings are all so over-the-top that they hardly feel real. It’s like these crimes and punishments come from deep inside human nature but only really exist on the page. I mean, who in real life would design such an elaborate puzzle and pull off a crime so perfectly? Christie basically set the gold standard for crime stories. No matter how clever later writers try to be, they’re just playing inside the little box she created. Take And Then There Were None - it’s the ultimate “desert island” scenario. 10 people end up stuck on a remote island, and a mysterious recording accuses each one of having committed murder to escape justice. Following the pattern of a creepy nursery rhyme, they get picked off one by one. By the time the police show up, all 10 are dead - no survivors. This book totally nails the genre and slices right into the heart of human nature. Christie doesn’t paint the murderer as some self-righteous judge; his final confession bluntly breaks down the 2 sides of our nature - the urge to kill and our sense of justice. Christie clearly thought that, deep down, people are pretty messed up. That dark side, all tied up with our biology and hormones, is thrilling and only gets stronger the more we try to hold it back. Once that urge pops up, the usual moral satisfaction just can’t keep it in check. And when it comes to picking his victims, the killer doesn’t come off as having some grand, hypocritical manifesto or self-delusion. He’s straight-up: he just wanted to kill a few people to get a thrill, so he chose some guilty folks to make it easier. That so-called sense of justice was just his way of deciding who to target - a way to comfort himself. What’s really chilling is his calm, calculated approach - even towards himself. He never deludes himself by thinking he’s some kind of hero; he just wanted to create a crime mystery as flawless as a piece of art. At the end of the day, we’re all selfish, acting according to what we want. Whether it’s for good or for bad, it’s just a choice to feel better. All 10 of these people, driven by different forms of selfishness, ended up committing murders that skirted the line of morality and the law. So, if you didn’t have to worry about getting caught, if nobody ever knew - would you ever kill someone, even just once? 4.6 / 5 stars",5.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"“When the sea goes down, there will come from the mainland boats and men. And they will find ten dead bodies and an unsolved problem on Soldier Island.” My first Agatha Christie, and a good one indeed. And Then There Were None just recently came to my attention. Maybe it was the new mini-series or the many people suddenly reading this, but I was intrigued immediately. I can't wait to watch the series! Agatha Christie totally tricked me. I thought I had figured it out, but I was wrong. This novel turned out to be exactly what it promised. A murder mystery, a mad psychothriller of a book. I would have liked a little more detail and character depth, but I have nothing to criticise in general. Would highly recommend.",4.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"Re-read #2 (11/28/2022) 5 stars. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 5 stars I truly believe this was the blueprint for every whodunit story! Ten people have been invited to an isolated island. One by one the guests are killed. After searching the island to find no one but them, they start to realise that the murderer is actually one of them. This is just as intense as it sounds. “Then there were none” is a masterpiece. It’s the perfect murder mystery whodunit story that I hoped it would be. It put me one the edge of my seat, kept me interested, and I drove myself crazy trying to guess what’s going on. I have to admit, it was brilliant and I’m thankful that we got an epilogue explaining everything because I was so freakin scared that it would end like that. With just the last chapter that didn’t give me a satisfying answer like what? how? why? Agatha Christie’s writing is so brilliant. I enjoyed most of her books and I always love that every time I read one of her books, it’s always hard to guess the murderer right. This is definitely one of her best books.",5.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"The ending was disappointing. I really liked the premise of this one. My first Agatha Christie book. I don't know what I was expecting but maybe I was expecting it to be damn perfect I guess. The characters were developed well but it's the last few crucial pages that went flat for me and the explanation wasn't appealing enough. I felt like the ending got a bit rushed and the few characters seemed bored. I loved how evil some of the characters deemed to be PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS (but actually ending up as dead bodies.) Damn. I say it's the fun while reading this book that made it so interesting. But from the murder mystery point of view, I did find it boring and rather flat towards the end.",4.0,positive,And Then There Were None,16159005
"A fantastically written mystery, which kept me guessing the whole time, and managed to surprise me with its ending! My first Agatha Christie book smashed it! What a genius! I thoroughly enjoyed this whodunit, and could not for the life of me figure out what was going on. Admittedly, I'm not great at figuring out who the villain is, but this was spectacularly written, and had me scratching my head! More importantly, the ending was great, it had me saying whaaaaat?! At first I thought I would be overwhelmed with the amount of characters introduced, but they were all vividly different, so it was easy. They were all pretty unlikeable characters, but that didn't matter at all, in fact I quite enjoyed that. I have nothing else to say, that hasn't been said before, so I will just end this with, “Ten little soldier boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were Nine.

"I enjoyed this book so much! It was thrilling, scary, gory and deceptive. Everything I need to bite my nails and tell the kids to shut up and get away. (JK... maybe) She sure knows how to set the tone. Who would have thought to make a serial killer with a conscience? And that sing-song.... nice touch, Agatha! I forgot to add that I bought this as a used book. Someone had highlighted and made notes throughout the book! It took away from me enjoying it fully because the person left so many clues. That was so annoying I couldn't concentrate on the story at times. If you write in a book DO NOT give it to Goodwill! PLEASE! I even went as far to research the making of this book wondering why the publisher's decided to change it from ""Ten Little Indians."" (Google it) I guess she was a bit of a racist and it does show throughout the book but to be honest it didn't take anything away from me liking it. I don't believe in banning or restricting books. If someone doesn't like it: don't read it, don't look it at, don't talk about it (Or vent about it to a friend and move on). Simple. Anyway, this was great and I will be reading more of her books.
