"one star While you were home sick with a flu, the love of your life had penetrative intercourse, at a party, at his old house, in a waterless bathtub, with someone else who smelt like musk and orange blossom and… tuberose (I think?) everyone who says that this book is a british version of gossip girl must be hating the show, because why then u insult it that much? one star purely for me for finishing this and vibing to drake’s songs while reading. the writing style in this book was hideous. when i say that none of the characters that were presented had personality i mean it. if magnolia(h) and bj(H) at least had 3 personality traits for each, then all of the side characters’ literally were the same person. all of their friends and other love interests were added only for minding magnoliabj’s business and push them back together. every time one of the friends was mentioned i was confused, cause i didn’t know if it was the new character or the old one . even the traits the leads had were mentioned once ot twice in the whole book, that i even forgot about some of them. for example, magnolia is “obsessed’ with fashion therefore there must be the plot line that would develop it somehow. the thing is tho that this book has no plot beside the constant back and forth between h and H. and instead of develop magnolia’s personality, the author decided to just constantly mentioning(in magnolia’s perspective ofc) who wears what. that’s all. her “obsession” is just being aware about what everyone wears and knowing famous clothes brands. bj doesn't even have that tho. beside that there was 37 mentions of adjectives “fucked up” and 10 of “fuck up” to describe hoe unheathly the relationship is. the metaphors tho were god tier as always. She’s the deer and I’m the wolf and there’s a massive truck headed right for us in the middle of a dark night.😐 i’m seriously scared to even think of the amount of rappers’ references this book had. I spent her seventeenth birthday party sweating fucking bullets because I’m pretty sure her dad told Kendrick Lamar and Travis Scott to stare me down and keep me in line. WHAT IS THIS ANBFKSLDOFKXLL WHY THEM LMFAO. and magnolia’s god father was elton john . GUYS there were moments where her father said something to her and she thought “elton hadn’t told me about it” GIRL😭😭. the romance aspect aka the plot go the book was so messed up and dragged out it’s laughable. at the end of the book there was presented three mf boys who were in love with magnolia BAHAHA i was dying. I’m gonna focus now on her and bJ’s relationship because if the book even had a theme it was them. first of all, the story even started off with bj being a cheater. we didn’t know him or why it happened, but we know he did. meet cute i’d say. there was the scene where he told magnolia about it and they cried together. He , quoting, cried so much he worked himself into a sort of panic attack. omg, are these… the consequences of your own actions??😢😨. she didn’t forgive him back then and they broke up. they’re were childhood besties, so in the timeline of the book they’re not together, but constantly have sleepovers(without sex or anything). also he’s a manwhore and fucks everything that moves. he’s that obsessed with magnolia that had sex with all of the girls she hated and even her friends 😍‼️😍‼️. and this is the explanation of his actions from his friend’s perspective: “You have sex with other people and tell her because when you do, it makes her sad and her being sad about that validates your feelings for her. She still cares. She wouldn’t be sad otherwise. She’s sad that I’m sleeping with other people, it must be because she still has feelings for me. You do it to feel close to her.” im speechless. why then he hadn’t fucked her mom?? it would be bonding to death and im sure he would feel the closest he ever had to magnolia🥺🥺. can even have threesome with the both parents for further effect. he must be crying over every orgasm he has, because he feels guilty for not being with magnolia. poor boy😞. btw my favorite scene from the book was this one: 1. bj gets a blowjob from the bartender in the bar next to the restroom 2. magnolia goes to the restroom cause she forgot her hair clip there 3. seeing the scene she runs away 4. next morning she knocks on his door 5. he lets her in and they start hugging 6. And then , quoting, my(BJ) hotel door opens, and Bartender fills the frame wearing my T-shirt and nothing else. and they say romance is dead. also, don't get me wrong, i love toxic relationship in books, but it should be mutual toxicity. magnolia and bj's relationship is not fucking toxic, it's abusive from bj's side. he's fucking up with magnolia's mind and not only hoeing around, but shove it right in her face. he doesn't respect her as a person. he's seeing her as a toy which he can't let go. but due to bad written characters(and everything for this matter) i coudn't even sympathise magnolia about being abused, cause she's completely hollow and uninteresting character as everybody else in this book. They all say yes because I don’t think anyone’s ever said no to me besides Parks. omg yes, she’s not like the others. she a fucking cardboard who cares about clothes and can say no to bj. she’s so special and precious we need to gatekeep❤️❤️ It’s going off. I’m not okay. I feel like I’ve fallen into a hole. No edge to grab, no end in sight, arse in your stomach, stomach in your throat, heart in the hand of a girl who’s holding someone else’s—just a kind of forever falling, this fucking suspending always falling, which is sort of what it feels like to be in love with her at this point anyway. these bitches not only boring but also very dramatic for no reason im losing my mind. why the fuck she or he was “dying” like this every chapter? magnolia acted shocked every time she caught bj with some other girl like it's something exotic. and in every goddamn chapter they were just going on about how they love each other and how their love is ruining them, while bj, even counting his ""obsession"" over magnolia and abusive behaviour, had more chemistry with a cocaine line than with her. now, the best part of the bj was his ✨ sexist part ✨ “It killed me when you were with him,” he tells the window. I wriggle closer to him, rest my head on his shoulder. “I’m sorry.” aww the poor boy is jealous that his girl is spending time with someone while he’s fucking the whole city. we all sorry for u, bj babe it must be so hard to be you😢. “Get the fuck out of my face.” He grabs my wrists and holds them tight and I don’t want him to let them go because I’m scared of what happens when he does. “Oh, is that what you want now?” he yells, and we’re devolving. no, i want u to die but not all dreams come true. it’s very sexy, that bj thinks that he has any rights to be jealous or aggressive toward magnolia, while he’s a fucking piece of cunt who cant keep his dick in the pants for more than ten minutes. one of their female friends told him that she cheated on her boyfriend and he gave her his precious opinion: “You’re sleeping with Jo.” She gives me a look. “I know.” “Fuck, I hate girls.” I shake my head at her. уеба💋💋 but if u think that he’s the only hypocrite and mysogynist there, then u so fucking wrong. Magnolia rolls her eyes and goes around hugging all of our friends, and especially not hugging Taura, whom I toss a consolatory smile to. so she thought that her boyfriend cheated on her with their friend, so she forgives him while not forgiving her 😃. this couple fucking deserves all the shit they’re going through and more. i hope they’re going to fucking die together. i wish these cunts would drown in their own shit. the mysogyny is the real theme of this book tho. y’all saying that this book is realistic?? go fuck yourself. no character development would repair the damage i have after reading this. all of the side characters pushing bj and magnolia together and saying that parks should be with him, because they’re soulmates. there was literally no one(beside magnolia’s nanny who eventually turned out to be her dad’s mistress LOL) who said that bj is toxic. everyone, absolutely everyone said that they’re belong together and he’s the love of her life. their parents were fucking cheering when they started dating again. i’m so grossed out it’s insane. romanticising relationships where the girl takes back the man who’s fucking up their lives must be fucking shameful. “But he’s just…. sort of… stupid. Especially with you.” He sounds annoyed about that part. “With me?” I smile, feeling awfully high and mighty. “Yep.” is it her fucking problem that he’s stupid?? does it seem like igaf? he’s 25 year old. when i first found out i couldn’t believe it, because even to call him teenage boy would be an insult to other teenage boys. the romanticisation of toxic relationship here is fucking insane. is my reaction on all of this supposed to be like this?? omg he’s so obsessed with her, that he’s thinking about her while having sex with other girls? omg this is so romantic💗. omg he’s snorting cocaine because of how in love he is with her and can’t get over their relationship? i want what they have💗. omg he has 22 tattoos about her and she’s thinking about them while having sex with another man? they’re soulmates💗. just tell me, how from all the spermatozoids their fathers spilled these cunts were the ones who made it? HOW? mm and now we’re getting closer to the most interesting parts. namely,✨ the love square ✨ so, magnolia in this book had 3 love interests. tom england(her childhood crush), christian what-the-fuck-is-his-name-even(he’s their friend i guess. i don’t remember who he is really) and ofc blowjob. i didn’t expect to laugh more than i already had, but here we are. at first there were only bj and tom. at the beginning magnolia and tom started to fake dating(for who-the-fuck-knows-what reason) and then they fell in love. fyi he’s in love with his dead brother’s wife, but then suddenly turned out that he’s in love with magnolia too. for my sake let’s pretend that they have some relationship development and chemistry🙏🏼 “I(Tom) watched you hurt her in that club, thought I could help her level the playing field. But now I think I’m a bit in love with her—” I(BJ) nod, getting it. “She has that effect on people” “I know,” he says, solemn. “I’m sorry.” I clock him. “For what?” “Because I like you, man.” He smacks me on the back. “But if I have a shot here, I’m taking it.” I give him a look. “Same, bro.” can someone tell that it’s the dialogue between 25 year old and 31 year old?? can someone at least tell that that’s how people talking in real life?? and then christian’s “girlfriend” revealed that he’s in love with magnolia too BAHAHHAH LMAO I LOST IT BJ looks from me to Christian and then cries to the sky. “Are you fucking kidding?” He looks down at me with wild eyes, wide and sore. “Is two of us not enough?” IM ROLLING OM THE FLOOR. JESSA HASTINGS REALLY DECIDED TO FUCK UP THE WHOLE BOOK. THE COMEDY QUEEN FR. WHERE IS MY ORGY ? WHAT A WASTED OPPORTUNITY IS THIS UH?? “Why the fuck are we talking about this? Again. We’re not talking about how I fucked up, we’re talking about your colossal fuck up. With my best friend. Who’s in love with you now.” save me. pls save me. i can get over never written threesomes and i can bear dumb dialogues and dumb ass scenes. but what i can’t get over is when a manwhore and LOVE INTEREST calling the “girl of his dreams” a slut for having sex with another man. “You love me. Everyone knows you love me.” I gesture around us. “I know you love me. Your boyfriend(Tom) knows you love me. Even you know you love me. Except you’re fucking him,” I yell, and I sound savage. “So who’s the real slut?” ебанная свинья right here❤️‍🔥. im speechless. no comment literally idk what to say. im fucking sick. i can throw up. this piece of shit was forcing her to date other guys, cause she tried to get over his cheating and now he’s slut shaming her for that?? very swoon- worthy im fucking done. this book and all the characters in it are abhorrent. im disgusted by every single character beside maybe tom (but the thing is with him, is that he knew magnolia since she was a teenager and said he had a crush on her for A LONG TIME😃😃. no comments im tired). and the fact that i know that magnolia and bj are gonna be together eventually fucking disgusts me the most. the author tried to explain magnolia’s behaviour by her having daddy issues, but the leads are gonna end up together so why does it matter? this book is a cumwipe with a big portion of the romantization of serious illnesses, toxic relationships and drugs addiction. in short, everything i’ve ever wanted in one book. lastly, everyone cried at the end, but i didn’t. i just laughed my ass off. the hilarious part was that the reveal of the girl bj cheated with should’ve been shocking, but i was lost because i didn’t even remember who the girl was in the first place. and his thoughts about the cheating were my last straw. And you want to know the god honest truth? I wasn’t thinking of Parks. All I was thinking about was that was what I wanted. It was what I wanted. I was choosing it. That was what I wanted to be doing and I was doing it, and I had a girl in my hands that I wanted there, and we were touching and kissing and that was what I wanted. hopefully everyone has a good day after that and all bj's stans satisfied with this plot twist. and i'm not judging u for loving certain books, that's fine all of us have different tastes, but i AM judging u if u want magnolia to stay with bj even after what he'd done. this is unacceptable and i think i already explained why.",1.0,negative,"Magnolia Parks (Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",58527403

"➸ 4 stars ”how many loves do you get in a lifetime?” summary: gossip girl (but set in london’s high society) meets the addicted series but make it more toxic and messy. — this is the must infuriating, addictive, heart wrenching and frustrating book i’ve EVER read - it literally sucks you in right from the first few pages. holy fucking shit everyone in this book is downright insane and they all need therapy, but i absolutely loved this book and these crazy characters, they served the found family trope so perfectly — this friend group is just so messy but there’s also so much love there. a found family through and through, they raised each other and are definitely each other’s real family. I WANTED TOXICITY, DRAMA AND ENTERTAINMENT AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT. i’m still sick to my stomach over the last two chapters, im reeling.. it’s going to take me 5 business days to recover from that. fuck u paili and ur sad smiles. ➷ this is not one of those unrealistic, cutesy, romantic stories. this story is so real and raw and shows how love can be so painful and damaging but in a sense also beautiful. this book is about that exhausting, never ending toxic, first love and the pain you go through just bc you just can’t let each other go and move on. this is two people who are so intertwined that they cant understand a life where they don’t have one another in some way. they can’t let go of their past with each other and will do anything to keep them in their lives. they are both so codependent in an unhealthy way and are each others anchors, no matter how much they hurt one another and everyone around them, there will always be that magnetic pull between these two. bj and magnolia are those characters that are not rly meant to be loved. they are real, messy, toxic and flawed. i was so connected to their story and was rooting for them — the love they have for each other just pulled at my heart strings; it is deeply felt on every single page but at the same time i was hoping they wouldn’t end up back together bc i wanted to seem them grow as individuals. but through all the ups n downs, i will still forever be a magnoliabj apologist they are just soul tied <33 — let’s talk about tom for a sec bc that man had me feeling all soft n shi. he was mags safety net and treated her like the queen she is. he was so caring, attentive, respectful and just so mature. on that note, JUSTICE FOR TOM!! he deserved so much better. he’s a walking green flag, give this man his own book NOW. ”how’s the weather over there, parks? “warm enough.” ”how’s the weather other there, beej?” “clear skies” ➳ magnolia: i was waiting for her to know her worth the entire book. she had every single guy she would meet wrapped around her finger but she still would always choose and run back to the most toxic guy in existence. she is me, i am her. i understand why she always kept going back to bj bc that’s her first love but it was just a never ending cycle of back and fourth. i’m rly hoping she grows as a person in the next book and learns not to be so codependent on bj. but she is my fav it-girl, it is so easy to sympathise w her character even tho she made some pretty shitty choices. the way i just wanted to knock some sense into her, she would constantly take shit from bj and then forgive him 5 seconds later. like girl you need to WAKE UP. but i love her and i will always be her #1 fan, she deserves the world and nothing less. — i absolutely love the bond w her sister bridget. she’s the only sane person in this book, calls everyone out on their bullshit and just slayed. ➳ bj: (terrible name btw) i have the biggest love/hate relationship w his character, but i have faith in him that he will start making the right choices. i will always have the biggest soft spot for flawed characters, but fkn hell was he a shitty person. like yes he is so stupid, yes i want to put his head through a wall but he was so deeply flawed and broken it was just so hard for me to dislike his character. i just wanted him to leave magnolia alone until he got his act together and started respecting her. the way he had the audacity to blame her for his shitty actions, like WHAT, HOLD UP this is YOUR undoing 😃 he knows how much his actions affect her and he still does it bc he’s obviously a sadist. he hates seeing her sad, but he is the one who CONSTANTLY MAKES HER SAD.. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. but onto the cheating - i never understood why he cheated bc he was literally pining for her, is deeply obsessed w her and acted like a lovesick puppy the entire book but then when she asks and he says “because i wanted to” no, nope, absolutely not. wtf do you mean you didn’t regret it or didnt think abt magnolia whatsoever.. i just 🕳️🚶‍♀️sir you’re going straight to hell. i hope he gets hit by a car and i hope i’m the one driving it. his only redeeming quality is that he has 22 tattoos dedicated to her <33 “everything wonderful, everything magical, everything painful, beautiful and spectacular and wretched and defining that had happened to me happened with him. and i hate him for that.” — these characters infuriated me, yet i couldn’t get enough of them, im obsessed 😭 they brought me drama, they gave me trauma bonds, they fed me angst, and then they left me w immense heatbreak. the author fr made me feel every emotion possible. i felt like all the betrayals were happening to me, her writing is just so beautiful, whimsical and poetic. these characters are not at all black and white—they are all extremely gray. this book was so over the top, dramatic, angsty, toxic and i need MORE. this story isn’t going to be for everyone you will either love or hate it or both. this book is honestly no plot just ✨vibes✨ if you don’t enjoy the cheating trope, love triangles, manipulation, toxicity then i wouldn’t recommend this book. you have to go into this book knowing it is about a never ending toxic, dysfunctional relationship, and that’s never been my forte. so why did this book have such a strong grip on me?? i guess i thrive off other peoples drama. fav quotes: ”the problem with me and parks is, i think we love each other more than ourselves.” ”he’s the moon, and i’m the tides.” “can you die from a broken heart, do you know? and if i did and they cut me wide open, would i bleed loving him?” ”i know that some love is beautiful, and some is freeing, some unravels you, some love poisons you, some blinds you, some betters you, and some loves break you into in invisible ways that no one else knows about until you have to stand up and the weight of your love crushes your bones.” — this one made me cry!! ───♡───────────── omg this book gave me so much fkn emotional whiplash, im literally going through all 5 stages of grief rn. i feel sick and i need a damn drink. rtc 😭 in the mood for some rich people drama and toxicity 😍",4.0,positive,"Magnolia Parks (Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",58527403
"Don’t mind me just realized I have this 4.5 stars and not 5…. Had to change that REAL QUICK. Nobody talk to me. Im so unwell. WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST READ???!! What JUST HAPPENED?!! And I why am I so completely and utterly OBSESSED????? This was like watching a house catch on fire with your feet glued to the ground and eyes taped open. I COULDN’T LOOK AWAY! Was it toxic as all hell? Yes. Did it have some of the most infuriating characters who are in immense need of therapy? Yes. Was there miscommunication EVERYWHERE? Also yes. And you know what…. Turns out I go feral for all three of those things when done right. Listen I couldn’t tell you what that says about me but that’s something to unpack for another day. I cannot remember the last time I was so INSTANTLY sucked in to a book like this. Jessa Hastings has a way of writing her characters that makes you feel like you know them upon meeting them. I really did not expect to get this emotionally invested this early on but uhm I cried three times so apparently I also trauma bonded with these characters. This is the type of romance I had no idea I LIVE FOR! And trust me I know this is not for everyone but I feel like I just made this revolutionary discovery about myself as a reader and there’s no turning back. Typically I avoid second chance like the plague but Magnolia and Bj made me understand the sheer pain that is unique to a second chance romance and apparently I’m a masochist because I ate it up and left no crumbs. Personally I’ve always not so secretly loved toxicity and miscommunication in books WHEN DONE RIGHT, emphasis on it being done right. But I also understand why this book makes people want to rip their hair out at the same time. It. Is. Not. For. Everyone. I’ve never felt this many deep emotions while reading. Every single ounce of pain, love, betrayal, happiness, suffering Bj and Magnolia felt, I FELT. When they crumbled, I crumbled right along with them. There was not a single word I skipped in this book. Every single last page had me gnawing at the bits for more. Not one dull moment. I read this in less than 24 hours. No I INHALED THIS. It was twisted and toxic and DOWN RIGHT FUCKED UP, but the amount of love we get from these two at the same time…. I have emotional whiplash. Magnolia and BJ are so flawed and their actions are so disgusting yet they are fully aware of what they are doing and it’s like watching two people hold a match to one another’s bodies while covered in gasoline (sorry for that graphic analogy, again there’s something wrong with me). I am LIVING for the drama of it all like an addict that needs their next kick. Don’t even get me started on the DYSFUNCTIONAL found family that slithered its way into my damaged heart. I’ve never wanted to be a millionaire living in high society London as bad as I do now. All that being said would you believe me if I told you I CANNOT STAND our FMC Magnolia???? Don’t worry Bj I’m coming for you in a moment. This girl grinded my gears like nothing else. I’m still trying to figure out how she has all these men on their knees for her because like couldn’t be me. She’s insufferable in this book, I said what I said. But then at the same time my heart hurts so badly for her even though right now I want to smack her upside the head. Also could have done without her describing outfits in such detail. I just skimmed over those parts because it was like reading in a different language with how little I know about fashion. Bj…. Bj Bj Bj, sir. STRAIGHT TO JAIL FOR MAKING ME CRY FOR YOU! My friend Bailee has my mental stability in her hands at this point because she’s telling me to trust the process and I’m trusting her but MY GOD. His actions are so disgusting and made me sick to my stomach with the pain he’s putting himself and magnolia through. Number 1 on my shit list. But the fucked up thing is, my heart still breaks for him and it’s all JUST A MESS!! But then he has to go and love Parks so immensely and unconditionally and tragically making me care so deeply for him as a character while hating him so much at the same time! Make it make sense!!! Every single one of this man’s tattoos are for her. Emotionally. Attached. And it hurts. I can already tell from what little crumbs we got…. I will be a Julian girlie and I’m equal parts terrified and excited for that. Also the plot twist….. I saw it coming and I’m still ready to cut a bitch. A fictional bitch, but that’s semantics at this point. All in all, I’m feral for this. Im ready to hand my heart over to Jessa Hastings on a silver platter because I know it’s only going to get worse from here. I. Can’t. Wait. Final note, Jessa Hastings writing is so beautiful and poetic I think I highlighted this entire book. A book you’ll either love or absolutely despise no in between. This is entirely character driven with a cast of fucked up people that have YEARS of work to do. Strong slow and heart wrenching character development is what I live for. If you can’t stand toxicity and miscommunication and the cheating trope (though nothing is as it seems I’m told), don’t expect this book to be for you…. You’ve been warned. Quotes that tore me apart “Because loving him is the same thing as tossing the keys to my heart to a valet without a driver’s licence. He’ll drive me off a cliff.” “Everything wonderful, everything magical, everything painful, everything beautiful and spectacular and wretched and defining that has happened to me happened with him. And I hate him for that.” “Maybe the ship’s not still sinking, maybe it’s sunk. Maybe we’re on the seabed now. Maybe the ship’s wood is starting to rot and all the anchors in the world can’t save us anymore.” “because she can only hate me how she hates me because she loves me how she loves me.” “when it comes to her, I have zero instinct for self-preservation. I’ll die in her arms or at her doorstep trying to get back into them” “I watch her, the girl of my dreams, love of my life, alpha, omega, beginning and end, till death do us part and even then I’m still hanging on” “He’s killing me. Loving him is killing me too, and I’m afraid because how many loves really, do you get in a lifetime? How many chances do you give it before you let it go?”",5.0,positive,"Magnolia Parks (Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",58527403
"i don't get this book. i don't get the MC's reactions to things. every time BJ would hook up w another girl (which is literally every other chapter) they would both act so surprised like it was the craziest thing to ever happen, like his dick entering someones vagina was this unexpected and undeterrable event that just fell out the fucking sky chapter 1: bj fucks a random girl chapter 2: magnolia cries, yells at him, storms off, forgives him chapter 3: bj fucks a random girl again chapter 4: magnolia cries, yells at him, storms off, forgives him chapter 5: bj fucks a random girl- DO YOU SEE THE ISSUE 🤬🤬 DO YOU SEE HOW THIS MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT.....

"Jesus H. This is got to be the worst book I’ve ever read. I can’t even tell you the plot because I genuinely don’t know what I just read. It’s just two adult children fucking other people and whining about how they love the other person So MuCh. If I had to read one more head to toe description of an outfit including the designer, pattern, and season, I was going to scream. This is two people that never grew up after high school and need to either go to therapy or leave each other the hell alone. It’s not romantic??? It’s annoying and toxic. Good god. If you like to read about 25 year olds that sleep with everybody but each other, an MMC that cheats cause he feels like it, painfully detailed descriptions of outfits that only the Kardashians could afford, a FMC that has three guys dangling and in love with her cause she’s “quirky and mysterious”, and a group of friends that have ZERO personality, this is for you. Also WHY is this 500 pages long?? There is no reason on earth that this book should be so damn long. They don’t DO anything?? They just party and brunch and emote all over the place for 500 pages. The ending didn’t make me cry and I’m a big baby. I was relieved that it was over because this was a mess from top to bottom.

"”How’s the weather, Parks?” ☀️🌦️⛈️🌩️ THIS HAD NO BUSINESS BEING AS GOOD AS IT WAS I am a WH0RE for drama. And this book delivered. I am speechless. Literally every single character in this book is messed up. Except Bridget I love her she calls them out on their shit. They were all such awful people but you can’t help but feel so sorry for them and root for them it makes no sense but it makes sense okay?! ”He’s a time bomb for me, do you see now? That he’ll hurt me. He’ll always hurt me. I’ll never be safe with him, even if I’m always safe next to him.” I’m so mad at BJ right now I feel like he personally hurt me lmao but I also just want him to be okay because he is so clearly not okay and it’s so heartbreaking to read. ”I’ll love him ’til I die, love him ’til it consumes me whole and kills me dead—so maybe love doesn’t conquer all but just some.” Magnolia is so flawed but she’s also so fragile and I get her so much. She frustrated me at times but it doesn’t last long because she’s really just hurting and you can feel how much it’s all affecting her. She definitely makes questionable decisions but so does everyone else around her (I’m especially looking at you BJ). She’s also practically Blair Waldorf so I immediately have to stan. But also I hated that whole friend group at times!! At first I was like why are they not helping them figure out their shit then I realized it’s because each one of them is more messed up than the rest. Did i love it though? Absolutely. ”I loved him. Really loved him. To the bone, I loved him. Cut me and I'd bleed him.” This book is so beautifully written and the love portrayed is so powerful and earth shattering, yet so broken and ugly. It just feels so real to me. BJ and Parks reminded me so much of Lily and Lo at times so I automatically had a soft spot for them sorry but so not sorry. ”I love you, he blinks. Prove it, I sigh.” This isn’t some black and white story. It’s painful and you definitely feel like you’re being pulled in one direction then the other like why is his entire body filled with tattoos for her and why does he have her entire week schedule memorized in his head and why is she all he thinks about and yearns for but yet he continues to hurt her every chance he gets?? WHY ”There are all sorts of love in this world and mine is killing me, I think.” I honestly did not expect this book to make me feel ALL THESE EMOTIONS but I am a broken mess. I still feel like I have so much to process. I may have pulled out some of my hair and had my heart skip a couple beats and drop outta my ass but this was incredible. ”Can you die from a broken heart, do you know? And if I did and they cut me wide open, would I bleed loving him?” 🐝🌳❤️‍🩹",5.0,positive,"Magnolia Parks (Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",58527403
"2.5⭐️ oh I get it!! we are supposed to read this book so we know what a toxic relationship looks like to avoid it all costs 🥰🥰 ~ “Who will be your maid of honour—me or Paili?” I give her a look. “We just started dating.” “Yeah,” she says, “but he’s the one.” Is “the one” in the room with us? Is that sarcasm 🙃? Is “the one” the same BJ in this book?? Tom is clearly “the one” to everyone who possesses proper thinking abilities ~ “Hello,” I grin at the shop girl—give her what Parks calls “the magic smile.” Girls do weird shit when I flash them the magic smile. One time a girl fainted.” why does every character sound like this but none of them acts it or are actually like this- just Tom had a bit of an impressive lifestyle but even his personality was boring. So much back and forth, I thought there would be no closure as Bridge pointed out, no fixing of toxic patterns. Cycles are bound to be repeated. Jessa clearly knows the relationship is everything that is toxic and wrong with codependency and infidelity and wishes it to remain how it is, everyone accept it or go find something better. I strongly recommend you go find something better. *** when you see this on your homepage, tell me whether I should or shouldn't read this series 👀",2.0,negative,"Magnolia Parks (Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",58527403

"“Can you die from a broken heart, do you know? And if I did and they cut me wide open, would I bleed loving him?” The rumours are true, this is the British version of Gossip Girl in a book. It's messy, the characters are imperfect, it's full of drama and toxic behaviour 24/7 and I LOVED it . I was honestly expecting to hate this book, but I was really living for the drama. Gossip Girl will always be superior in my eyes but this does come close to replicating the feeling of that show. I was so conflicted about how I felt for the majority of this book, it's unlike anything else I've read. It was a turmoil of emotions from laughing fits, blushing, anxiety, yelling/screaming and wanting to peg the book across the room (more time spent feeling the latter). It was so toxic but I ate it up 😩 While I did predict the ending early on, nothing could stop my stomach drop watching it unfold. “How many loves do you get in a lifetime? I remember wondering that. How many people will look at me like he does, not just like I’m the sun but like I’m the whole god damn universe.” Keep in mind this is fiction. Jessa's writing is stunning and it really does romanticise the toxic behaviour. Her ability to capture emotions is jarring and really puts you in the place of the characters. It is easy to get swept up in this book and in my case, make you question yourself for sympathising with these characters 🤭 I lived for the drama but if Magnolia was my best friend I would be telling her to run so fast 🏃‍♀️💨🚩 For once I can say I'm so glad I'm not the one living in this book. “He's killing me. Loving him is killing me too, and I'm afraid because how many loves really, do you get in a lifetime? How many chances do you give it before you let it go?” I'm fairly impartial to the couples at the moment, I mainly enjoyed the drama but I am hoping for some redemption and character development. The toxic nature of this can get a little repetitive which stopped me from giving it 5 stars. At the moment a lot of the characters are surface level and could do with some depth over the course of the series. I knew what I was getting myself into when I started this series and it delivered mostly everything I was expecting from it. This is not a series I would recommend to everyone as you will either love/enjoy it or HATE it . If you loved Chuck and Blair at their most toxic state, you will probably enjoy this. This has some heavy themes and it will likely trigger you (it did me at points) but I still loved it. I'll summarise my thoughts on the characters so far below but I suspect this will change as they develop over the series: Beej needs to be checked into a facility. I really want to love this man but his nasty 🍑 is making it hard for me to do that. One minute I find him sweet and the next I want to reach into the book and slap him 🤡 You know what you did. “The lights go off and she stares at me through the darkness a few seconds longer, and I love her in the dark. I mean, fuck it— I down and out love her in all spectrums of light, even the absence of it.” Mags is literally Blair Waldorf and I kind of love her despite her being messy and self-destructive. She is the moment, she's iconic, she's the it girl. She makes terrible decisions the majority of the time and probably should be in counselling but she delivers queen behaviour 💅 She honestly deserves better. I won't make excuses for her but I want to give her a hug because that inner monologue in the last two chapters? It was written from my own head I swear. Reading her story with Beej was like a train wreck , you knew the impact was coming but you couldn't look away. I couldn't help but secretly root for them through most of this book despite it defying all logic and common sense. “I remember it, like a physical punch in the gut, how much I loved him. Really loved him. To the bone, loved him. Cut me and I’d bleed him. How much I needed him, still needed him, would forever, always, never couldn’t even if I tried, needed him.” Christian was a toddler chucking a tantrum for 90% of this book. He needs to stop his whining and get his own gf. Without knowing the backstory, it just seemed like he had a real sense of entitlement and knew what he was getting himself into but then tried to point the figure when the inevitable happened. Jonah you're a piece of 💩. Henry and Bridget are the only voices of reason in this book. Henry should probably find better friends, while he does stick up for people during this book he also enables some bad behaviour as well. Bridget is my fave, consider taking up a career as a psychologist babes because you've been putting in work with this lot. Tom England you can be my bf baby, I want you 😍 I see what you were doing but I can't blame the man. Also, the thing with his brother's wife? bit weird.. Daisy was only in this book very briefly. I thought she was kind of rude at the beginning but the second appearance had me on her side, she really put that man on blast in front of everyone (he deserved it) 🗣️ I can't wait to continue this series, I've got the popcorn out and I'm ready for all the drama 🤗🍿 ⎯⎯ ୨ Pre-review : ୧ ⎯⎯ girlies it’s finally happening 🫣 bc I love the drama tell me who your fave couple is if you’ve read this series 👀👀",4.0,positive,"Magnolia Parks (Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",58527403

How many people will look at me like he does, not just like I’m the sun but like I’m the whole god damn universe.” 😭🫶🏼 “Painful things can still be beautiful things, in case you didn’t know.” “It happens because people are careless and callous and casual with hearts and emotions, and those people are dangerous to be involved with and so even if you love them, you shouldn’t love them, because nothing is worth feeling how he made me feel, and there was no guaranteeing that what happened before wouldn’t happen again because the word of a cheater, she said, is void.” “Echoes through the ancient mountains around us and the Greek philosophers who waxed lyrical about true love and soulmates roll in their graves as I try for the billionth time to sever myself from mine.” Bye going to go stare at the wall ❤️",5.0,positive,"Magnolia Parks (Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",58527403
