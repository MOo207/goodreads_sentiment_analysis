"all the ⭐ in the Universe (because, hell, why not? It only seems fair that way) Full review on my Blog: 🐺 If I am the only weirdo that reads the dedication at the beginning of a book and rates it too in her own head then okay, fine, weirdo I’ll be, but I have to start this review by saying this. Sarah J. Maas dedicated this book to her parents. It is one of the most beautiful dedications I’ve ever read at the beginning of a book. It says: “For my parents – who taught me to believe that girls can save the world.” How beautiful and inspirational and worth of all of our respect is this? Once upon a time, not too long ago, my life ended brutally. The cause of my abrupt death was simple: Throne of Glass series has ended; the final blow – Kingdom of Ash . Barely 5 chapters in and I was already crying. In that moment I realised that I had a storm of tears ahead of me and there was no way in hell I might elude it. It felt like I was about to be hit by it. And hard. AND GUESS WHAT. I was. This book was everything to me. I have never in my life declared that I might have a favourite book, simply because I haven’t found the one yet and I thought it won’t be fair for the rest of the great books out there. Now I am going to make a statement I’ve never made in my life: until further information, Kingdom of Ash by Sarah J. Maas is my favourite book ever. I cannot understand how, but this book just crept deep, into the core of my soul, ripped it apart, ruined my sense of life and left me aching both of devastating pain and of speechless joy. It felt complete and at ease with the Universe and I am grateful that there is a book that can destroy me but still find a way to mend me. Not even the best review I could ever come up with can cover all the awesomeness of this book. But I'll try. As good as I can. But keep in mind: everything I state here is not even half as good as the book itself. It’s like trying to explain colour to someone who’s never seen the light of the day. Hopeful, but utterly impossible. “(…) to have the power of eternity in the palm of your hand.” There was a line from this Romanian book I once read that says: the time run out of patience. When there might seem like there is an infinite amount of time that no one can take away from you, keep in mind that maybe the time itself decides when it might want to leave. In Kingdom of Ash, the time felt like its own god and indeed, it felt like it run out of patience. Everything felt desperate, hopeless. Nothing went according to any plan. There were no gods above, no demons below. There was nothing. And the characters and the action itself seemed to feel that too – the anarchy. They were rushed but reduced to silent fight. They were pressed and oppressed. They ran out of hope but still kept looking for it. It was devastating. Throughout and beyond. The world-building was still absolutely fabulous. Plus, the insides of an actual, super scary, dark war were a super addition. “Let’s make this fight worthy of a song.” In this book, the characters are the ones who make the action. They were the most important tool in the destruction of me. So, I don’t even have the faintest idea what to tell you about them. I can give my heart, soul, both kidneys, half a lung and one eye to protect them all. They are precious babies. My precious babies. I fell in love with all of those fantastic characters. Like truly in love. They made me ache all over and they made me feel part of their lives. I laughed and cried with them, I fought and won. I suffered and I loved. That is the most precious thing a book can soothe you with. To make you feel included. Hollow and whole. I wish I could say more about all this. I really do. But I can’t. It doesn’t feel complete. By this book, I am forever undone. “Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young princess who loved her kingdom.”",5.0,positive,"Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass, #7)",76715522
"Here is my updated shelf! Here's my big boxed set with poster. And below it is my shelf with the goodies! 11-1-18 Got my UK Edition with the beautiful art cards inside! If you want to see pictures of my wall art then just scroll all the way down past the other pictures. This is how much I love this series. Also, let it be known (that I'm crazy) that I have the hardback, audible, kindle, special paperback on its way and then ordered the complete hardback box set! Yeah! THIS. BOOK. WAS. EVERYTHING.... TO ME! I loved this last installment so much. All of the characters I love were in it. There was torture, sadness, war, happiness and so much more. I cried <-- I mean of course I did, that's what I do! I'm not giving out any spoilers, I just wanted to say it's perfect for me. I really wish it never came to an end but there are only certain things you can do in certain series without messing it up. At least, that's my take on it. I really have no words peeps. I'm going to leave it here because there are so many that are going to be talking about this, I really wish I had a real life friend that read books that I do so we could talk on the phone about it. Anyhoo, enjoy my pictures. I have some funko's I'm making slowly and changing the ones I have made. I am working on a couple of walls that I have dedicated to book art and my photography! I hated removing those book shelves but I'm loving my art. (Will do a wall and new bookshelf tour later on) This first pic is just a couple of things. Later on I will do the whole shelf tour when more things arrive and get made. My wall art of Aelin & Rowan And the beautiful, Manon!

"Rereading this was both an immense joy and a mistake. Everything hurts but I’m so happy right now. —————————————— I mean, I’d be happy to swear a blood-oath to Sarah J Maas. So many thoughts were running through my mind whilst I was reading this, but now that I have reached the ending of this book, I’m just a mess of tears and emotions and I don't know how to express how much it all means to me. I think I can safely say that this is my favourite book of all time. It was transcending. Sarah J Maas is a Dreamer, and I don’t think any book has fulfilled my dreamer’s heart as much as this book. It satisfied me to no end. All my hopes and dreams were placed in these characters and their world and for the cause they fought for. It hit me deep and it has carved itself into me and gratitude alone does not cover the feeling I have in my heart right now. You write and read stories and dream up better worlds, so you can find some hope in time’s of bleakness, to get by, to will yourself to live another day, and look towards a future that is better than what you’ve experienced and are living. Hope emanated throughout my course of reading these books and what I was left with. All of their lives intertwined so beautifully, kindness being repaid with infinite kindness and I was being taught over and over again that goodness outshines and outlives everything. And then the acknowledgements happened... I’m just done with my emotions getting trampled all over. I such an awesome time reading this with ! The support was needed. 😆😘 I’m going to go onto my mourning phase now, which’ll last for... let’s not even go there. —————————————— Pre-reading ramblings: WE HAVE AN EXTRACT! “I will find you.” 😶😭😭😭😭 RIP, folks! I can't believe this series is ending. These characters have absolutely become ingrained within me and every year these books were the ones I would look forward to the most. Sigh... my heart is already starting to hurt and I'm welling up. Fuck knows how I'll survive reading this. —————————————————— THE EDIT IS CLOSE TO A 1000 PAGES. I REPEAT: THE EDIT IS CLOSE TO A 1000 PAGES!!!!!! 😭😭😭 —————————————————— Title and blurb in one day? I feel spoiled. As for the title... I love it. But there's a sense of doom I can't shake off now.

"“Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young princess who loved her kingdom …” I MADE IT!! And if I never hear a woman’s vagina described as her “heated silk” again, that will be just fine by me! Honestly, though, I have to give it to her: Maas showed a lot of restraint in this book. It was a good 350 pages before Rowan’s magical penis made an appearance 😬. Sorry, I just can't resist. Overall, I liked it enough to give it three stars. I mean, I read all of the bajillion pages, which is saying something. It's been a long ride. Emphasis on the long. I'm still perplexed as to why these books got so long in the end. has some really strong moments, but there's so much filler and repetition that you have to fight through the boring parts to get to them. This is, at most, a 500-page story, extended with long, slow stretches of the characters journeying from one place to another, and repetitive scenes of battle. Also: Chaol and Yrene are so dull. The first 100 pages and last 150 pages were the most gripping, for me. The conclusion is suitably dramatic though I'm amazed that everyone managed to survive and the beginning details the horrific torture Aelin suffers at the hands of Cairn-- it's not a book for the squeamish. The disgusting scenes of torture also become a little repetitive after a while, but it starts very tense. How will Aelin get out of this?? The answer is really quite satisfying, too. I do feel like this is a very long epilogue. There's battle scene after battle scene but not much of a plot. Dorian has an interesting part to play in this with his newfound abilities, which is one of the stronger aspects except the bit where he turns into a girl and, um, explores his new body *shudders* , but very little happens for an almost 1000-page novel . It's mostly about wrapping things up, tying up any loose ends and neatly establishing Aelin's awesomeness. The way each of the main characters has to be perfectly settled into a het pairing is a little forced, too, but oh well. Well, I'm glad I read it to the end, and I do feel a little sad that it's over. I've been reading these books for more than five years and I can't believe how much my own life has changed since I started. Maas might not be my favourite writer, but any author who can keep you reading for more than 4,000 pages must have something good going on. | | | |",3.0,neutral,"Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass, #7)",76715522
"Perfection. I am in awe and weeping, my remnants of a heart full. I was scared that this last book, through whatever course it took, might diminish my love for the whole series -- but gods, was I wrong. It was a thing of beauty, satisfying and heartbreaking in all the right ways. Bittersweet. I cried and sobbed, I gasped, I screamed, I smiled, I felt my heart beating out of my chest, I shivered, I swooned. I don't think I'll ever be able to write a proper review, but I still feel the need to highlight some elements that marked me (slightly spoilerish gibberish ahead). Fenrys & Aelin's silent language. Aelin not knowing what's real and what's not. Aedion hurting and being an ass because of it. Lysandra battling without stopping. Elide sprinting towards death for love. Ansel's soldiers. Aelin's scars. Rowan's vision. Dorian's lack of self-worth and perpetual need to sacrifice. Aelin crying when seeing her second love walk. Aelin realising little gifts pay off greatly. Aelin grinning and swaggering. Chaol running towards his King. Dorian thinking about Sorscha. Manon and the three Matrons. A Queen of Witches with a crown of stars. Aedion thinking about dying like his childhood heroes. Abraxos. The Little Folk. Petrah Blueblood. Gavin. Kaltain. Manon stopping herself from thinking about Dorian. The Thirteen, the Thirteen, the Thirteen. A tribute to the fallen. Dorian adoring his best friend's wife. Dorian as an uncle. The gods. Nameless is my price. Elena's soul. Mala's gift. The fall through worlds and the help received along the journey. A lion and his cub, together. Yrene Towers being amazing every step of the way. A queen defending the walls. Evangeline melting an old man's heart. Cousins finding one another, two faces of the same coin. A letter from a mother. The original trio and their incredible love for one another. A broken curse. Brothers by choice. Saying hello from time to time. A prince becoming a lord. A warrior becoming a lord. A field of blooming flowers. Looking forward to tomorrow. A better world. No, I'm not crying, you're crying. All these things above broke me in different ways, ripped me apart, some mending my heart back together. I am so in love with this story, so grateful for this fictional world and these characters, that I cannot quite believe it is over. It should be illegal to attach so deeply to imaginary beings, because it goddamn hurts when reality seeps in and they're no longer around you. My favorite series, without a doubt, one that I’ll cherish forever. Thank you, Sarah J. Maas, for sharing them with us. It has been a joy.

"I had impossibly high hopes for this book. I make no secret that this is my favourite book series. Yet somehow, every book just seemed to get better than the last. Could SJM possibly do it again. Yes, she can, and she did. Wow, what an epic finale. The book is a perfect length, though close to a thousand pages, not a single line is wasted. Every possible loose end is tied up. Every hint or hidden story leads to this masterpiece. The story is awesome. The character development and use are unreal. Every characters' moderation and reasoning is spot on. Every character has something to contribute. However, we still know who the hero of the series is. Action, adventure, suspense, and such intense emotion evoking writing. This could not have been done better. As mad as I was for having to wait an extra couple of years for this book to come out, it was worth the wait. I can not find a single negative thing to say about this book. Except the series is over. Though I think almost any surviving characters are good enough to have their own book (hint/begging). Aelin/Celaena is my favourite female character of all time. Strong, deadly, intelligent, and most of all, she ""will not yield."" I love that quote, and I honestly do not think it can be applied better to any other character. This is an awesome finale to the most awesome series after reading that all other games of thrones are secondary.

So fucking iconic Dorian: SWEET DORIAN. I think we would be good friends. I’m obsessed with you character and the fucking character development from you throughout this series has probably been my favorite character development ever Manon: pls come back marry Dorian and tie his life to yours ok thx luv u The thirteen: still crying Fenrsy: you deserve all the happiness in the world and a gigantic hug. I loved getting to see more of this character. Rowan ashryver gallithenius WHITETHORN: in love with you nbd. Rowan is so perfect for Aelin I can not. AELIN ashryver gallithinius WHITETHORN: m’y absolute favorite. Looking back to the first book to now is mind blowing. Character development insane but once a bad bitch always a bad bitch.

"I did it. I survived this hellscape. I don't know how. I might have shaved off about 15 years of my life getting through 980 pages in about a week and a half so I could get the book back to the library, but I did it. But, my God, at what cost. I'm not even sure where to start with this steaming pile of garbage. It was nearly 1,000 pages, and hardly anything of note really happened. It was filled with filler nonsense and ridiculous internal feuds that were not only pointless, but made absolutely no sense to even exist, especially with this world ending war on, just to fill pages. And anything of note that did happen was so sloppily handled that I wanted to scream. So where will I start? With the basics I suppose. I shall show you what basically set the tone for the book for me, and how I knew that every single page would be searing agony to get through. The very first page opens with these two lines: He had been hunting for her since the moment she was taken from him. His mate. SJMaas could not make it two lines into this book without saying the word ""mate."" This is what I mean when I say it set the tone for the book, because if you have read this far in her books, you know what I mean when I say that this entire book is filled with her heavy handed, badly written garbage. So, let's delve into the thick of it. I'm gonna try to be as organized as I can, but forgive me if things start to get a bit chaotic. It's hard to keep these raging feelings of absolute fury at bay. POVs: I have to start with the very first, glaring sin this book committed. The one that stood out as I got a mere twelve chapters into the book: the exceedingly unnecessary amount of POVs. Guess how many there were, dear reader. Guess, before I type it out. Did you do it? Did you guess? Drum roll please. There were fifteen whole POVs in this book. No, I am not kidding. Fifteen. Eleven of which, I believe, had been utilized by chapter twelve. Still don't believe me? I'm gonna give you each of them now. Aedion Elide Aelin Manon Dorian Lorcan Rowan Chaol Nesryn Yrene Lysandra Fenrys Random unnamed soldier for like a page??? third person omniscient POV at random points in the book Evangeline Yes, dear reader. This is what I suffered through. This outrageously ridiculous number of POVs, each one giving me Their Take on things going on, even if they are in the same vicinity as a character whose POV I just read. It was painful. So incredibly painful. The fact that Maas could not tell this story, could not express these characters' emotions without inserting us into their heads, is a testament to just how mediocre of a writer she is. And therein lies another issue with this unconscionable amount of POVS: none of them were distinguishable without her telling us whose head we are in. They all blurred together. There were times we would swap POVs and I would assume we were in Dorian's head, when we were in fact in Manon's. Or I would think we were in Rowan's head, when were in fact in Lorcan's. These characters are all so similar, all so boringly bland and indistinct, that the dozen of POVs we are subjected to all just wind up meshing together until Maas clarifies whose head we are in. That is just... so sloppy. So lazy that I cannot even fathom how this book was allowed to be published and made to be this long. There was no reason for every single main character introduced throughout the books to be given a POV. Absolutely none. Especially if you aren't even going to take that extra, necessary step to ensure that your characters aren't all just a carbon copy of each other. Vocabulary: Someone, anyone, please get this woman a thesaurus. I am begging you. If I never see the words mate, ancient, crone, decimated (Used incorrectly, I might add!!! Every single time!!!!), thrice (please, for the love of God, never say that word to me ever), snows (I still don't know why she pluralized it every single time), sang, and a whole slew of other words that I just could not be bothered to write down, it will be too soon. I don't know, but as an aspiring writer myself, I'm always looking up words and their synonyms. Looking for different ways to describe things, different words to get my point across. Maas has apparently never heard of a thesaurus. I am certain of this, as the word ""thrice"" did not start appearing in her books until Tower of Dawn where she took every single opportunity to just sprinkle it throughout her prose. A trend which unfortunately extended into Kingdom of Ash . It was like someone told her this was a word that existed, and she completely forgot that you can say ""three times"" or just straight up not specify that it was done more than twice. For the love of god. But, anyway, enough of my ranting about that cursed word. Back to the matter at hand: any object or person more than fifty years old was ""ancient."" Every woman over 60 was a ""crone"" (an incredibly derogatory word for old women, its overuse continuing from where it began in Tower of Dawn ). I still don't know why snow was described as ""snows,"" as I have never seen that extra ""S"" added to the end of the word before now. Everything was ""decimated,"" despite its actual meaning pertaining to ""kill one out of ten of a group of soldiers as punishment"" thereby not really causing a lot of destruction. Oh, and everything ""sang"" to these characters. Their blood, the wind, their weapons, their magic. You name it, it sang to them. Please, Maas, for the love of god, just keep google open as you write and type in ""[word] synonym."" It'll be enlightening. I swear it. Listen, I know all writers have words and phrases they fall back on in their styles, Lord knows I am one of them, but that's what editors are for! To point these things out to the writer so they can be fixed!!! Where are her editors!!!!! Where are they!!! Character Mutilation: I don't mean this in the sense of extreme violence. Well, not in the literal, physical sense, at least. I mean that none of these characters are who they started out as—and not in the good ""character development"" way. For example, Manon. The badass, remorseless wingleader of a coven of bloody-thirsty witches. Evil, maybe even swinging toward morally gray, she was one of the most interesting characters. With teeth of iron and nails to match, she bowed to no one except her grandmother, and ruled over her Thirteen with an iron fist, letting everyone know who was in charge. Well, since Empire of Storms she's been thoroughly declawed. She's just like everyone single one of these boring as hell characters. Completely good, despite a lifetime of being taught to hate and kill. Conditioning like that cannot be cured in a few short months, Maas. No matter the revelations. And please do not get me started on how she wound up basically begging Dorian to not go to Morath alone. On her knees before him, offering him marriage if it meant him staying. Manon Blackbeak of the Ironteeth, cowed before a man, offering to shackle herself to him. Maas truly is the queen of ruining her own characters. It would be impressive if it wasn't an affront to the written word that her series are so damned popular. Dorian, too, is a shell of his former self. I don't know how to tell Maas this, but suffering from a traumatic experience doesn't suddenly make you a cold, boring bastard who's into BDSM. It was a weird shift that was literally just so that she could write yet another male character who falls into the only mold that she knows how to write. And there is also Lorcan, who was the one Fae character I liked. He was turned into a carbon copy of Rowan. The reason I had liked him was because he was a bastard! A bastard that maybe felt something for the human in his care! And there is nothing I love more than an immortal who hates everything, falling for one mortal and damning everything else in their path. But, nah, he's totally good now, too. Don't worry about it. I could go through each character and point out the various ways that Maas completely destroyed everything that made them interesting (here's lookin' at you, Chaol Westfall, my former favorite character in this series), but I won't, because I do have a character limit that is dwindling fast. So let's move on. Specific Grievances: I suppose I can attempt to tackle this now. I'm gonna be real, I didn't start diligently taking notes until I was about halfway through the book, maybe slightly less, so the first half is a bit of a muddled blur. So I'm just gonna dive right into everything that ground against my very soul. I'm gonna be bouncing around a lot, and will likely not even touch on everything, but I'm gonna try. My God, I'm gonna try. First and foremost: OP Dorian's magic being able to take literally whatever form he wishes—including shapeshifting. (He is able to keep his clothes on because he is just So Good at it, unlike Lysandra, a born shifter, who is naked every time she shifts back into her human form. Is it bad writing or sexism? Who knows!) After a few days of practicing, Dorian is basically a master shifter. That's not even the real problem I have! The problem I have is what Maas decided to do with it. In order to practice this, Dorian turned himself into a woman, a Crochan witch to be exact as he and Manon are living amongst them. So I had to read Maas describe Dorian describe what it was like to be in a woman's body. What the boobs felt like, how he had to learn how to walk like a woman (women walk a certain way??? We walk, Maas. We walk like every other human being. You are a woman. You should know this.), and then he used his ~invisible hands~ to caress Manon while in that form after she found him out. It was an insult, honestly. That entire scene was an absolute travesty that amounted to nothing in the end other than showing how great Dorian is. I want to have a word with Maas over that scene alone. Going off of that basic idea of Dorian being all powerful, for the love of God is Maas able to write one (1) ordinary person? Every single character in this book is touched by a god, blessed with power of catastrophic levels, fated to be something great, or the descendent of some long forgotten dead royal line. Manon is the last Crochan queen, Elide had some god who I cannot even remember who they are looming over her shoulders, Yrene is blessed by the god of healing and is the Best Healer Ever, Chaol is tethered to that greatest healer ever, Dorian is OP as all hell, Rowan and every single Fae is powerful and perfect, Nesryn has become a ruk rider who is going to become empress, Lorcan had the god of death following him, Lysandra is a shifter, Aedion is part fae and the best soldier ever. And then there is perfect Aelin. I'm sure I don't have to go through her merits. God, she makes me sick she is so ridiculously overpowered, even after Maas attempts to nerf her. Throughout my entire journey reading this book, Syndrome from the movie The Incredibles rang in my head: ""When everyone's super, no one will be."" Which is basically what this book came down to. Everyone was important! Everyone had some sort of fate/destiny thing going on with them! Not one person was ordinary!! Do you know how boring that makes a plot? Even with the cartoonishly evil Erawan and Maeve with their stupidly big army, nothing felt like a threat to these people! Someone always came along to help them, because they had so many Super Friends. I was never once afraid for any main character's life. A shame about all of those faceless grunts, though. They never stood a chance in this plot. I've been saying this for awhile now, but I'll say it again, Maas needs to learn how to keep her stakes small. She escalates the stakes in her books to these laughable heights, that there's no fear of loss or failure anymore. I didn't fear the villain who barely had any page time. I didn't fear Maeve, whose real identity reveal was little more than one of Maas' infamous retcons so she could pat herself on the back for being such a genius writer. I didn't fear Morath's army or the witches. Nothing made me care about the fate of any of these characters, because I knew they would all be fine, I knew they would beat Erawan and Maeve. I always said that the big bad should have been Arobynn. He was infinitely more interesting than any other bad guy she threw our way. And guess why: Because the stakes with him were small, personal. He was a very real source of agony in Aelin's life. Before the retconning that happened in Empire of Storms, it was no fated meeting. He was just an arrogant, self serving man who used an orphaned girl to his advantage and molded her into a weapon for his use. Defeating him, taking down the Assassin's Guild, would have been a much more interesting plot. But she basically turned him and the Assassin's Guild into a foot note, choosing instead to have this stupid, apocalyptic plot instead. Sacrificing emotion and feeling for blockbuster proportions of writing. And yet this book has a 4.71 rating on here right now. A fact that actually hurts the depths of my soul. Anyway, speaking of SJMess retconning, she's at it again, folks! And you'll never guess how. So, she never named the King of Adarlan. Could never be bothered to. That's just classic SJMess, not naming her villains (shoutout to the A Court of Thorns and Roses series with yet another cartoonish villain whose name is still not clear). But guess what! That's actually Erawan's fault! He wiped the King of Adarlan's name from his memory, from history to ensure he was completely in his thrall. So, never fear, readers! Maas has an answer for everything! Even her pisspoor writing and world building. Oh, and it's later revealed that the king's name was Dorian. That he remembered his name for but a moment, when he first held Dorian in his arms, and bestowed his name upon him. Because Maas is so lazy that she couldn't even come up with a different name for the man. Jesus Christ. I really need to address Maas' idea of military strategy next, because as someone who has read countless books, both fiction and nonfiction, about war and battles and actual military maneuvers, this book ground against every single nerve in my body. For whatever reason, Maas thinks battles happen for hours straight at a time, ending at sundown on the dot, and not picking up again until sunrise. First and foremost, [John Mulaney voice] no. Night is the best time for fighting! That is strategically the best time to launch a counter-offensive! Your enemy is tired, any sentries they have dozing, and the bulk of their forces are exhausted beyond measure. That is the perfect time for your ground forces to sneak in and launch a surprise attack! Doubly so if your army is made up of demons who supposedly dwelled in the darkness in their home world! And so much of war and battle is waiting. Waiting for the enemy to strike. Waiting for your superiors to make a decision. Waiting for who will make the next move. The fact that Maas' war was so structured, that Morath's armies were so polite to give their opponents clockwork attack patterns, is infuriating. The way this war was fought, the counter-force should have won despite the numbers against them. Attack at night, you absolute idiots!!!!!!!! And then there were the specific military maneuvers!!! Okay, so, you may remember these ""witch towers"" that produced an attack power of Biblical proportions. Or perhaps not. I sure didn't. There is too much going on in these books. Anyway, there were witch towers pitted against Orynth. They started out well against them once they realized they were in play, and dug a trap to take them out, and successfully destroyed three out of four of them. Good job, guys! Proper counter-offensive! But, they only disabled one of them. That's fine. You can deal with that later after you push back the army. Except they didn't. They completely forgot about it. Even after Manon and her Crochans showed up and the Morath army was so shocked that they pulled back for the night, they didn't plan to take out the tower!! They completely forgot about it until it took out a whole chunk of their aerial legion!!! Proper military strategy would have had the aerial troops scrambling to take out the witch tower first. They would have had squads running defense, drawing fire, and entering dog fights while a main squad went for the witch tower to take it out. They supposedly spent an entire night strategizing, and no one thought to bring up the veritable nuclear bomb on the field? The fact that everyone just Forgot about the temporarily disabled witch tower and now it's not only functional, but prepped and ready to blow apart their army and city just shows how little SJMess even looked into actual warfare. Or maybe her characters are just this stupid. I don't know anymore, but I'm tired of knowing more than this best selling author. All I know is she needed a Dramatic way to give Manon more angst by making the Thirteen sacrifice themselves to bring down the tower. Because she's like the Joss Whedon of books. Okay, I'm running out of room so I'm gonna aim at the last two things that made me want to blow my brains out: 1) Out of the main characters, no one died. The only semi-main character death count were Gavriel and the Thirteen, both of which chose to die to help the army. No one's death was out of their control. No one just had a bad case of wrong place at the wrong time. What kind of war is this? What the actual hell, Maas? Do you know how many people die in war despite the fact that they were highly trained and skilled specialists? I cannot stand this woman and her writing. 2) She couldn't help herself. She just couldn't do it. She just had to put Rhysand and Feyre in this book. Sure, it was barely half a page of a cameo, but she just couldn't help herself. She just couldn't resist the opportunity to jack off directly in my face. If I hadn't already been over halfway through the book, I would have stopped reading right there. It was the most nauseating thing I had ever seen, and if I ever have the chance, I will absolutely say that directly to her face. I didn't even scratch the surface with this review. I have an entire google doc filled with every single thing that pissed me off, and it's at least three pages long. It's apparently bad to suppress a magic wielder's magic, as Aelin found out after two months of it, and yet the entire country of Adarlan suppressed magic for a decade and absolutely no magic wielders had any ill effects. Aelin's magic was drained to the dregs to forge the Lock, and yet she was able to fight Erawan and Maeve with her ""limited"" power the entire time and never once actually ran out. I can keep going! I could go on and on! But goodreads has decided that this is enough, as I am down to just a few hundred characters. Bottom line: This series was garbage. I started out liking this series and Maas' writing, but as I've discovered, Maas' talent doesn't lie in writing, but in brutally mutilating her own creations until they are unrecognizable husks of what had once made them even the slightest bit interesting. I am grateful to be done with this series. I'm grateful to be rid of SJMaas. And no, I don't recommend these books to anyone. Save yourself and just go read Holly Black's books if you want actual faerie content.",1.0,negative,"Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass, #7)",76715522

"""What if we go on, only to more pain and despair?"" ""Then it is not the end."" I've never cried so much over a book. Never. There were points were I had to stop reading because I couldn't see the page through my tears. This was a journey, and I don't just mean this book. This whole series has such a special place in my heart, and what I think a lot of people don't realise is that the Throne of Glass series, like the Harry Potter series, was designed to age with its readers. The teenagers who started reading this series at the release of Throne of Glass are now adults, and this series was written for us: to grow with us into our adulthood, to walk with us from our frantic teens to the endless possibilities of our twenties, to change and adapt as our priorities in life naturally do. I started following this story, of Celaena in a glass castle, solving mysteries and fighting duels, when I was 19. Now, at 24, I've turned the last page of Aelin's story, but it doesn't hurt to say goodbye. It feels full, like a beautiful finished painting, a tapestry with every thread neatly tucked away. If there was a better way to end this, I can't think of what that might be. This series has meant a lot to me, and while it has its flaws, it's one of those stories that I'll come back to again. Because the themes are timeless, of bravery and love and healing, of family and redemption and hope, hope, hope. All of the books, but this one in particular, is at its heart about the power of never giving up, and of standing up for what you believe in against impossible odds. The wins and the losses - terrible losses that made me openly sob - were sore but meaningful, and that's the greatest triumph of this excellent last chapter. That it all meant something, and that even the small ones, the most unlikely of heroes, the ones that no one saw coming, left their mark. I've gained and lost a lot of possessions in my life, but my books are important to me. My books have travelled with me across seas, across continents, across great and sometimes painful frontiers in my life. This series is the reason why my books mean so much to me. Because they're transformative, evergreen, a truly powerful form of art. And wherever I end up, wherever that might be, I'll take these ones with me.",5.0,positive,"Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass, #7)",76715522
"""The crow-that-did-not-smell-like-a-crow"" And that's it! Seven books, each getting longer, complex, but most importantly, better than the last, every time. Now, Maas has given a near perfect conclusion to this lengthy series with Kingdom of Ash. ""It's too late for speeches."" By now, there is little new to tell about writing style, character development, and the flow of story. Each of these things are considerably improved to where we started with the first book. The author has come a long way, and done a remarkable job with this last installment to give the series a thorough ending. Given how complex the plot is, and the number of loose ends by the end of last two books, I'm surprised how well she brought everything together, handling each thread perfectly. ""Let's make this a fight worthy of a song."" As the events in fifth and sixth books took place in the same (parallel) timeframe, first third of Kingdom of Ash deals with bringing the dispersed characters to two main plot-lines. What follows is absolute chaos, each group fighting their own battles, until we reach the concluding war. Even with a number of defeats, I liked Aedion's side of the battles more, which seemed more dramatic and emotional at the same time. ""We are the Thirteen from now until the Darkness claims us."" ""What was stolen has been restored; what was lost has come home again. I hail thee, Manon Crochan, Queen of Witches."" All my favorite characters in this series came from third book onwards, starting with Manon (and the Thirteen), then Rowan, Elide, Nesryn until we met rest of the cadre, Yrene, Borte and many others. But from the original trio, I only came to admire Dorian, and not Aelin and Chaol. It was touch and go for a while, but I'm glad the direction Dorian was assigned at last, allowing him to redeem himself. I didn't hate Chaol by any means but lost interest somewhere along the way, so he didn't made it to my favorites. As for Aelin, even though her character had gotten somewhat better in time, she still had a number of inconsistencies in my opinion. But the other characters held the story together for me... until now. I knew the author would have to get rid of some good guys eventually when the wars took place, but I guess I wasn't ready for the losses. They were heartbreaking, and it has been one emotional roller-coaster ride with this last book. I certainly understand the necessity to kill some characters to make things seem more real, but it's never easy. Still, I cannot help but commend the way Maas handled everything towards the end, even doing justice to those who were lost. ""Don't burden yourself with the what-ifs."" Kingdom of Ash gave one of the most complete endings I've come across in a while. The author did not leave a singe loose end, and brought everything together perfectly, and very patiently. I guess it shows how much Maas cares for this series. ""A loyal friend is a rare thing indeed."" I'm not going to say it has been a smooth ride with Throne of Glass. Especially not with the underwhelming first book, and a below average second. But Maas recovered quite well as the series progressed. The third and the fourth made revolutionary jumps in my opinion, where as rest maintained evolutionary improvements. Now that I've finished the series, I feel like the seven books belongs to three sub-series, consisting of one trilogy, and two duologies: first two books as an introductory duology, third and fourth books along with the sixth as a build-up trilogy, and fifth book and the seventh to conclude everything. I know this entire series has been praised by many as a good romantic fantasy series, but I was never able to get in to that part here. I still don't understand why Maas decided to take things to adult (or new adult) by focusing on romance aspects a lot, but I guess it's just me. But in the end, I really enjoyed this series. Towards the second and third books, I was certain I would never re-read this but considering how good it was towards the end, I might just re-read this someday. Special thanks to , and for convincing me not to give up from the outset. Had I given up because of first two books, I would've missed out on an amazing adventure.

There isn’t going to be any outward spoilers however i never said anything about it being a coherent well-presented review 🤗🤗🤗 Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young princess who loved her kingdom … let me just start off by saying that this book made me cry a RIDICULOUS amount of times. when the characters were hurt: tears. when they were happy: weeping. when they cracked a joke: S O B B I N G Aelin described my current state best when she said, ”“I’m going to have a terrible headache from all this crying, and you’re not helping.” im not even joking, my eyes were so red and puffy and I think my tear ducts expanded and I got dehydrated from all the crying I endured.

"3.75 - 4 Stars All things considered, I enjoyed this book and series a great deal. As the conclusion to a pretty popular and lengthy series, it had a lot riding on its massive 980 page shoulders...and a LOT of uber-emotional fangirls and boys to avoid disappointing, let's be real. Overall I thought Maas did a pretty decent job of it... ...even with all the filler, all the battles, ALL the traveling to and fro...all the unnecessary ... ...until about page 770 or so. This book was...long. Probably longer than it needed to be, quite frankly. I saw that some people had said that - and I didn't agree, at first. I was more than perfectly content, even at page 600-something, to relish these characters and the individual storylines that made for such an epic ending for as long as it lasted. However, at about 770-800 pages, some events in the book made me...less than enthused. With all of the build-up regarding the final ""showdown"" and the closing of the Wyrdgate...I was bummed with the way it all went down. Not gonna lie, since the time it was all explained, I have wondered about the Wyrdgate...and been a little confused by it all in a way. So many gods, blood debts, and other stuff involved. And when it finally came to ""the moment,"" as it were, I was kind of a little miffed. Especially when Aelin ends up losing her Fire-Bringer powers. I'm sorry, I'm all for the ordinary being all extraordinary and all that...but I also like my ""super-heroes"" to have their super powers. And after so many books of Aelin finding and then learning to control this power...for her to just lose it in the end, right before the big battle? Also, the whole part with Dorian... When he learned how to shift, I was like, cool. That's cool. But when he goes to Morath, encounters Maeve, and supposedly dupes her? I just have a hard time believing he was able to do that. To overpower her and outsmart her with his magic like that after people much older and experienced with magic, i.e., Rowan and the cadre, have been unable to do so for millennia . And then, not to fucking kill her right then when presented the opportunity? And don't even get me started on the final showdown. Once again, Maeve seems to easily take control of everyone's minds (making my point with Dorian even more ridiculous), once again she seems to so easily overpower them all. Le sigh. It just felt drawn out and repetitive. Again. Also, I was kind of left a little blue-balled by how things ended between some of the characters. But I think by then, Maas realized she was encroaching on 1000 fucking pages. And, by then, there were just SO many damned story lines, it would have been almost a whole other book to properly ties up all the loose ends in regards to everyone's story, relationships, and future. But, whatever. All in all, I enjoyed the majority of this book. There were some REALLY poignant moments Manon and her Thirteen, anyone? Holy-throat-tight-with-emotion right there, people. And in the end, I think the idea that you can have friendships and relationships you would be willing to sacrifice your life for?

"1. Throne of Glass ★★★★ 2. Crown of Midnight ★★★★★ 3. Heir of Fire ★★★½ 4. Queen of Shadows ★★½ 5. Empire of Storms ★★★★ 6. Tower of Dawn ★★★ 7. Kigndom of Ash ★★★ Reseña en español. OH POR DIOS. Pensé que, al terminar de leer esta saga que me acompañó durante tantos años, sentiría mucha satisfacción. Tal vez un poco de tristeza. ¿Pero saben qué? No siento nada de eso. Solo siento... ¿indiferencia? Estoy feliz de haberla acabado porque VAYA, sí fueron muchos años y quería saber la conclusión de la historia de Celaena Sardothien, pero en general solo estoy feliz porque ya quería que se acabara. Ahora, hablando de este libro en particular, pues estuvo bien. INNECESARIAMENTE LARGO, eso sí, pero bien. Se cerró todo lo que se tenía que cerrar y SJM se aseguró de que cada personaje tuviera su final, fuera cual fuera. Hubo partes tan aburridas que de verdad me las quería saltar, todo lo de Aedion y Ren y Rolfe y Darrow (y todos esos personajes que ya ni siquiera recordaba) no podía interesarme en lo más mínimo; pero en general todo lo demás me mantuvo entretenida, y sí tuvo uno que otro momento cardiaco. Aunque, siendo sincera, jamás temí realmente por la vida de los protagonistas (me refiero a Aelin y a Rowan). Sobre las parejas. Ay, pues qué les digo. Todas fueron muy heterosexuales, jajaja. Pero eso no es lo que más me frustra, lo que me frustra es que ¡¡¡TODOS TIENEN QUE TERMINAR CON PAREJA!!! Todos. Se me hace poco realista y muy forzado. Y obvio todos terminan siendo reinas y reyes de su respectivo territorio, ufff (pero eso ya se veía venir desde Empire of Storms). Y hablando de las parejas... no me gustan Aedion y Lysandra. Este sujeto la trató de lo peor. La humilló y la denigró. PERO AHHH CLARO, el peligro de muerte llega y ya con eso todo queda perdonado. Nope, no lo creo. Y bueno, ya saben que no soy fan de Aelin y Rowan, pero en este libro estuvieron más aguantables, las escenas de sexo no fueron tan inoportunas. ¿Lo que más odié? La obsesión de SJM con el vínculo ""mate"". BASTA. Y o sea, ¡es la palabra que más se repite en el libro! My mate, my mate, mate, my mate, mate, MY MATE. Yo ya no podía más, ya solo me quedaba poner los ojos en blanco cada vez que la leía (y fueron muchas veces). ¿Lo que más me gustó? Elide y Lorcan, los amo, quiero que sean felices para siempre. También me encantó el papel que jugó Yrene en el libro, creo que ella se merece todos los aplausos. OH, y no puede faltar mi adorado Dorian, todo lo que logró en este libro me hizo sentirme bien orgullosa, ¡ha crecido tanto y se ha hecho tan fuerte! Lo amo. También Manon es increíble (pero ella siempre ha sido increíble). OHHH, también me encantó que SPOILER: Al final Aelin camina victoriosa y llama a todas las mujeres y amigas que la ayudaron. Se me hizo una escena bien bonita y poderosa y llena de girl power y sororidad. Ahora quiero hablar de los personajes, esta sección VA A TENER SPOILERS, quedan advertidos. NO LEAN MÁS SI NO QUIEREN SER SPOILEADOS. Aelin: Celaena era una de mis protagonistas favoritas, la amaba y amaba leerla, pero desde que se volvió Aelin, cayó de mi gracia. Creo que en este libro pude entenderla un poco más y además pude empatizar con ella. Y si bien ya no es de mis favoritas, sí quería que las cosas salieran bien para ella. Con Aelin aplica mucho: ""Look at where you are, look at where you started."" Ella ha luchado con todo su ser durante este viaje y siempre mantuvo la esperanza. Estoy muy feliz por su felicidad. Rowan: Este sí no podía importarme menos. Me caía bien en el tercer libro, amaba su amistad con Aelin, peeeero como interés romántico es de lo peor, y como personaje... pues meh. Si él moría no me hubiera importado, aunque sí me hubiera puesto triste por Aelin, que obviamente no podría vivir sin su adorado mate. En fin. Bye Rowan. Dorian: ESTE BEBÉ HERMOSO. Jamás me gustó como interés amoroso para Aelin, pero como personaje siempre lo amé. Creo que a Dorian nunca le hicieron justicia en el amor, la tal Sorcha era súper irrelevante, siento que SJM solo la inventó para que no se quedara solo (y luego se dio cuenta de que a nadie le importaba y por eso la mató). Ahora, sí creo que Manon ha sido su mejor interés amoroso, y me gustan como pareja, pero no quiero enfocarme en eso, sino en el desarrollo del personaje. Dorian empezó siendo un simple príncipe engreído y se ha convertido en un rey digno y fuerte, ¡estoy muy orgullosa de él! Sin Dorian no hubieran podido reunir las tres llaves, y tampoco hubieran podido acabar con Erawan. Además el arco de su papá sí me conmovió. Ay, Dorian, eres el mejor. Chaol: PUES Chaol, pobre bebé. Él era mi personaje favorito de la saga, pero en el cuarto libro SJM lo arruinó por completo y logró que hasta a mí me cayera mal. Luego en Tower of Dawn empecé a soportarlo otra vez y podría decirse que se redimió. Chaol me agrada, y también estoy orgullosa de hasta donde ha llegado. ¡Y estoy feliz por él! Me encanta que sea feliz al lado de Yrene, ellos dos me gustan mucho juntos. Manon: REINA ABSOLUTA. FIN. No tengo mucho qué decir de Manon. Ella, sin duda, es mi personaje femenino favorito de esta saga. También recorrió un largo camino y aprendió mucho y no solo eso, ¡logró hasta lo imposible! Estoy muy orgullosa de ella. Bien por Manon (y Abraxos, el mejor, lo adoro). The Thirteen: Las tenía qué mencionar porque AHHHHHH, su muerte fue lo que más me enfureció (y dolió) de este libro. Cuando lo estaba leyendo no lo podía creer. ¿TODAS, SJM, ES EN SERIO? UGH, ni siquiera pude llorar, solo estaba enojada. Sí, creo que su sacrificio fue muy importante, pero también sentí que SJM simplemente se deshizo de ellas. Pobre Asterin. Pobre Manon. No supero esta muerte. Yrene: ¡Yrene salvó al mundo! Wow, creo que es el único personaje que de verdad me gustó en Tower of Dawn, y en este libro me deslumbró más. Me encanta la forma en la que enfrenta sus miedos. Me encanta que lo dé todo. Yrene para presidenta, pls. Lorcan: BEBÉ OSCURO. LO AMO. Él sí que atravesó un viaje total en este libro, y me parece curioso que SJM logró que me encariñara con él en tan pocos libros (pero bueno, sí fueron muchas páginas, jajaja). Me gusta que, aunque Lorcan demostró que tiene corazón, sigue manteniendo su esencia oscura y malvada, pero al mismo tiempo puede ser súper soft con Elide. Elide: ¡Reina también! Todos la subestimaban por su tobillo, pero ella demostró que es la mejor. Y fue otra pieza esencial para derrotar a Erawan. Además siempre se mantuvo firme en lo que quería y siempre mostró valentía. Al inicio de este libro me desesperó un poco por terca, pero en parte la entendía. Al final simplemente la amé. Fenrys: Lobito bebé. Me encantó. Ojalá que sea feliz siempre. Rhysand: Ya me habían dicho que había un momento en el que Feyre (embarazada ajá) y Rhys aparecían en el libro, y debo admitir que, cuando leí esa parte, me emocioné un poquito. Me gustó la forma en la que Rhys ayudó (?) a Aelin, creo que fue un buen toque. Y ya, creo que son los únicos que valen la pena de mencionar para mí. Los demás personajes fueron meh. Por último, iba a decir que el capítulo final me pareció muy bonito y poderoso y significativo, pero luego me enteré, por varias reseñas, que lo del Kingsflame (que fue lo que me encantó) parece una copia de El Señor de los Anillos, del Árbol Blanco de Gondor. Entonces estoy: decepcionada. Pero fuera de eso, ¡pues AHHHH, al fin acabé esta saga!",3.0,neutral,"Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass, #7)",76715522
"✨Endless stars, infinite stars!!✨ [old review] ""Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young Princess who loved her kingdom . . ."" Throne of Glass is my all-time favorite series. Kingdom of Ash is epic in every sense and every way. There couldn't have been a better conclusion to the series than this. Sarah J Maas seamlessly brings all the storylines together and boom , each character got an ending worthy of them in the story, whether it's a happy, bittersweet, tragic or a well-deserved end. Aelin, Aelin, Aelin . Following her through her entire journey, seeing her grow, experiencing her pain, feeling her joy and witnessing the rise of a Queen. She is my absolute favorite heroine that embodies everything I love in a female character: her saddeness, flaws, sarcasm, selflessness, perseverance and her remarkable iron will. ""She made herself look. To face down that place of pain and despair. It would always leave a mark, a stain on her, but she would not let it define her. Hers was not a story of darkness. This would not be the story. She would not fold into herself, this place, this fear, but it would not be her story."" Just like it did the first time, Kingdom of Ash managed to turn me into a sobbing mess. There was so much going on and I feel the strings in my heart being pulled and pulled until they tore out and my heart was left seeping with overwhelming emotions. ""Let's make this fight worthy of a song."" It was worthy indeed. A song that will echo throughout eternity, of heroes and villains, of magic and darkness, of Kings and Queens, of Kingdoms and of wildfire and wind, of shapeshifters and healers, of soldiers and witches, of the living and the fallen. Aelin and Rowan . What can I say more? Truly? What words could do justice of the bond and the love between them? ""The story of them. Rowan and Aelin. A story that had begun in rage and sorrow and become something entirely different."" The characters, all of them , what more could I write in this review to even express just how much I love them? I feel like my tears are about to fall again and I believe that is a sign to end this review. I know I could've written a better review than this for the conclusion of my favorite series, but I don't even have the words, the proper words to write. Until we meet again, Aelin Ashryver Whitethorn Galathynius , it will always be a great pleasure to follow you through your journey. To whatever end.",5.0,positive,"Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass, #7)",76715522
"I am in tears. This was absolutely perfect. I have no complaints, no remarks, no anything. I wouldn't change it at all. SJM wrote a masterpiece and am absolutely in awe of it 😭❤️ KoA is easily the best book in the series for me. Sure, it's hugee. But the characters, the story, the romance, the war and sheer beauty of it all was mesmerizing to read. How come there's no tv series for it yet?! It started with such intensity and heaviness. Aelin, Rowan and Fenrys are the winners for me in this book, they broke and mend my heart. Chaol and Dorian coming in next, with Manon, Lorcan and Elide at the end. I know it's an odd way of ranking but that's the way they impacted me. If you haven't read this series, DO READ IT. Pls 🥺🥺 I have some theories in my drafts but before posting them. I want to reread ACOTAR and CC. ~•~•~ Y'all have me so scared to start this one but here I go. Also, after this I officially start my reread of ACOTAR and CC- am ready to start theorizing for CC3",5.0,positive,"Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass, #7)",76715522
