"In a Nutshell: Expected far more from my very first Kristin Hannah book. Loved the intent, found the content so-so, disliked the writing. This is, as is obvious, an outlier review. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Plot Preview: 1966, Coronado Island. Twenty-year-old Frances McGrath, known to all as ‘Frankie’, belongs to a wealthy family of navy veterans. At the send-off party for her elder brother who has enlisted for Vietnam, someone tells her, “Women can be heroes, too.” This sparks a desire in Frankie’s mind to serve her country through the armed forces, something she never considered before. As the only corps willing to take a freshly-graduated nurse is the army, Frankie, against her family’s wishes, registers with the Army Nurse Corps and sets off to Vietnam. There, she sees the true picture of war, where every day is a fight for survival. But will this struggle end with the end of the war? With war protestors becoming stronger by the day, the Vietnam veterans might not be coming home to the open arms of their country. What lies ahead? The story comes to us in Frankie’s third person perspective. Bookish Yays: 😊 The intent deserves credit: to focus on the women veterans of the war, to depict what women can do, even if they aren’t allowed to. 😊 The war-related scenes are as gruesome as expected. Felt like I was right there in the war zone with Frankie. 😊 The focus on the importance of and the struggles faced by nurses and the secondary treatment they are given compared to doctors. 😊 The details about the mental struggles and health issues faced by returning veterans, which went much beyond typically shown in fiction. Bookish Mixed Bags: 😐 Frankie starts as a great character. Even when she is a naïve fresher, she has the right approach towards her work. But as the book progresses, her decisions start turning more and more impulsive and short-sighted. I don’t mind books with unlikeable characters as they add a nuance of realism to the story, but in this case, Frankie’s behaviour, especially in the second half, was more frustrating than understandable. 😐 The Vietnam war is not called the ‘American War’ by Vietnam without a reason. I appreciate the author’s decision to highlight even the American atrocities and the lies spun by American politicians. Though these negatives are not covered in as much detail as I would have liked, they are still enough to shed light on the truth. However, the depiction of the American troops in Vietnam is white-saviour in approach for the most way, focussing more on the medical aid offered by the Americans to the locals than talking about why the locals needed the aid in the first place. 😐 Most war books stop at the end of the war without showing the aftermath. That is one aspect in which this novel excelled; it went much beyond the timeline of the war and shows the reception of the Americans to the returning veterans, and the protests. However, the depiction of these events seems a bit exaggerated. I am obviously not privy to what happened in 1970s America, but I find it hard to believe that not even one person knew about women serving in Vietnam, or that not a single person showed sympathy to Frankie’s mental situation. The author’s note mentions that women veterans often met with dismissal, but ‘often’ doesn’t equate to ‘always.’ The balance is missing. 😐 Frankie’s downward spiral in the second half is, in one way, a good creative call as it shows us the darker side of PTSD. However, the events get tedious and repetitive after a while. Plus, the hyper-drama level is way too high in this section. 😐 While there are some interesting secondary characters in the book, they barely get proper detailing. Most of what we know about their background is the little we get from passing references in conversations. Many characters disappear without a trace as soon as their purpose is served in the plot. The one I am most curious about is the senior nurse who greets Frankie on her arrival in Vietnam. What happened to her? There were at least three skilled nurses that we know of (Ethel, Barb, and the senior nurse), but we hardly get to see them in action. Why does Frankie have to be the one to save the day, every time? The character decisions also induce much eyerolling. Whenever there is a party, the nurses drop everything and rush off, without asking or informing anyone. How is that possible in the army? 😐 For the first time ever, I, a big fan of author’s notes, have mixed feelings about the note in this novel. I appreciate the clarity the author provides about her intention behind this book and her research sources. Two issues, though: 1. She has no first-hand experience of Vietnam ( which is very evident in her writing about its weather ), and 2. She said that she wanted to change the place names and war unit details for ease of writing, but changed her mind only after veterans told her not to. I find it very odd that an accomplished writer of historical fiction even considered falsifying factual details just to make her task easier. Bookish Nays: 😣 The writing was the biggest disappointment. This book is much overwritten. At 470+ pages, I thought we would hear multiple women’s perspectives and experiences in the war. But unlike what the title suggests, “The Women” is mainly the story of only ONE WOMAN – Frankie. Moreover, there is too much of telling in the writing. Every single outfit worn by Frankie and the others is described in elaborate detail. Actions are narrated step by step. Every now and then, we see the time mentioned in army style – “At 20:15” – as if to remind us that Frankie is now a military member. The foreshadowing is too blatant. One phrase that comes up multiple times is “How long had it been since…”. The worst of it is the character resurrections – yes, plural! The effect is repetitive and annoying. 😣 The romance is cheesy and unappealing. Every single guy who has a proper role in the story falls in love with Frankie. We are expected to believe that this is common during the war time because of the low number of American women around, but in that case, how come Ethel and Barb and the other nurses didn’t have anyone falling for them? As it is, I don’t like romance popping in non-romance books, but it is even worse when the writing is so corny and the situations so lopsided. The lack of appeal in the male characters doesn’t help. 😣 There is not a single Vietnamese character of importance in the whole book. Moreover, the representation of Vietnam is, as expected, focussed on the problems: rats, malaria, heat, lack of potable water,… Though the Americans enjoy water-skiing and swimming and so on in the local lakes, the beauty of the location is rarely described. The funniest to me was the finger-pointing at Vietnam’s monsoon for causing Frankie’s travel bag to stay musty and stink even eight years later. Sorry! But if your travel bag is odoriferous, it’s probably because you haven’t washed it, ever! Don’t blame the monsoon! 🎧 The Audiobook Experience: The audiobook, clocking at almost 15 hours, is narrated by the inimitable Julia Whelan. Need I say anything more? Everyone who knows audiobooks knows that she is among the best narrators. If you still want to try this book, the audio version is definitely a fabulous way to check it out, especially considering its length. All in all, I do appreciate the author’s efforts and the intention that made her write this book. I even liked certain aspects of the storyline, and loved learning about the nurses who gave so much to the fruitless war. But the writing and the plot development were not to my liking. The problems are exacerbated in the audio version as it feels like an endless journey through monotonous situations. As is evident from the current rating on Goodreads, mine is very much an outlier opinion. Most other readers have not just loved the book but are positively gushing about it. So please go through their reviews before taking a final call. If you are the kind of reader who prioritises sentiments over plot and writing, you might love this novel way more than I did. 2.25 stars. My thanks to Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for the ALC of “The Women”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the audiobook.

"Don’t believe the lie if somebody insists that there were no women in Vietnam. They were there! They served their country, struggling with tragedies, PTSD, and casualties as well. But there was one crucial difference for them: they were never considered war heroes. Nobody applauded them for the sacrifices they made or awarded them medals. They didn't receive praise for their service, and when they attempted to speak about the psychologically consuming experiences they went through, they were silenced, as they weren't even recognized as veterans. This work is dedicated to the women who served their country both militarily and as civilian women stationed in Vietnam – heroines who need to be remembered, praised, and admired. This time, Kristin Hannah takes us back to the mid-sixties, shortly after JFK was shot in Texas. The country's primary focus is battling communism, and in pursuit of this mission, numerous troops comprising young Americans are sent to Vietnam. I highly recommend keeping some napkins, handkerchiefs, or tissues close by, as you'll need them during your reading experience. Another word of caution: don't plan anything extensive for your day, because once you start reading this book and tell yourself you'll only read a few pages before setting it down, that plan might not hold. From the moment you dive into Frances “Frankie” McGrath’s story, you'll become engrossed. It's almost as if you're under a spell – you won't be able to put it down. Her story will grip you, tearing at your heartstrings and evoking numerous tears, as you connect with her fears, heartbreaks, pains, anger, and frustrations. You can practically hear her internal screams and the words she's forced to bottle up because nobody wants to listen. She might be the most honest, poignant, tough, and resilient heroine the author has ever created. So, my advice is to clear your schedule, go with the flow, and allow the story to transport you to the jungles of Vietnam, where the echoing sound of helipads reverberates in your ears, and you find yourself in a hospital surrounded by young soldiers uttering their final messages to their loved ones. The book commences at a house party on Coronado Island, celebrating Frankie’s brother's enlistment. Frankie decides to take a break in her father's study, where a ""hero’s walk"" is displayed, featuring photos of the family's men who served in various wars. Now, her brother will be added to this wall. But why can't she be included too? It's in this moment that she realizes her brother's best friend, Rye, is also hiding in the room, questioning her: why can't a woman be a hero as well? This question alters everything for Frankie and challenges the life plans her family has set out for her. They expect her to marry and have children, conforming to the norms of the early sixties. However, she decides that she, too, can be a hero, serving her country and making her family proud, just like her brother did. She applies to the Army Nurse Corps to follow in her brother's footsteps. Her conservative and highly respected family doesn't support her decision, and when a tragic piece of news arrives unexpectedly, Frankie's life takes a sharp turn before she embarks on her earth-shattering journey. Soon, she finds herself amidst chaos and destruction, realizing that as a young, innocent, and inexperienced woman, she's like a fish in a bottle tossed into a dangerous ocean teeming with sharks. Within a short span of time, she becomes terrified, numb, and exhausted, navigating days where her heart breaks as she witnesses soldiers younger than her brother losing their lives and civilians becoming expendable amidst the chaos. As Frankie edges closer to collapse, nearly drowning in sorrow, her friends Barb and Ethel extend a lifeline, offering enough emotional support to keep her from giving up. The book takes us on a 20-year journey with Frankie, spanning two terms of her life as she struggles to save herself. She risks her life in the process, and upon her return, she realizes that she's not regarded as a war hero like the men who fought in combat. People avoid discussing the war, and even her own family treats her as though she's done something to embarrass them, something they'd rather not acknowledge. During the day, she's compelled to blend into the community, resuming where she left off before the war, while at night, she battles her nightmares and the clutches of PTSD. She comes to understand that she's not the proud, ideal girl her family wanted her to be and never can be. Eventually, she gives in. Frankie's painful journey, marked by her substantial losses, her battles with addiction, and her anger toward those who betrayed and disrespected her, is portrayed with remarkable realism. You can feel her emotions; they're everywhere. You ache, you cry, you feel resentment, and you sigh. You experience every pain she carries as if it's a blow to your own face. She's one of the women from the war whose stories need to be told, remembered, cherished, and respected. Will she overcome her inner demons? Will she learn to heal from her pain, forgive those who worsened her suffering, embrace her flaws, and confront her fears that she's afraid to share with others? Will she ultimately find the peace she's searching for? Read her story to uncover the answers. I'm still recovering from the impact of this book. My heart is a whirlwind of different emotions. While some characters may seem fictional initially, as you delve into their stories, you'll develop an immediate connection that makes these characters a part of you, lingering in your life indefinitely. Frankie is one such character – unforgettable, courageous, vulnerable, tarnished but not broken, poignant, and dependable. I believe this might be my favorite work by Kristin Hannah. After reading her closing note, I gained a deeper appreciation for the years of hard work she put into creating these vivid characters and crafting realistic descriptions of war zones, leading us on this unforgettable journey. This book will likely be one of the standout reads of 2024, and I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to read it.

"Well, I am going to be That Person. That Person who does not rate the book everyone is raving about 5 stars. I just can’t. And here’s why… First of all, I do want to say that I very much appreciate that Kristin Hannah chose to write a novel about something other than World War 2. It was refreshing to read about the Vietnam War, a war about which very few novels have been written. Furthermore, I appreciate that she focused on the women. Women’s contributions and experiences in history are often overlooked and probably more so in regards to the Vietnam War. I, for one, honestly never thought about it. Secondly, Hannah does capture the setting very vividly. There are a lot of gory war scenes, you can feel the heat of the jungle, the stress, the exhaustion, etc. Similarly, she captured the experience of PTSD well (as far as I know, not having experienced it myself). I think it’s important to have this experience vividly exposed both for the sake of empathy as well as for those who have gone through it to feel heard and seen. She clearly did a ton of research on PTSD as well as on the war and the time period. So why not the raving 5 stars? Quite simply, because Kristin Hannah likes to jerk people around emotionally and because the romance in this is obnoxiously awful. First things first - and I don’t have anything else to say about this - I despise the title. Moving on… **A few spoilers ahead.** Emotionally, this book is seriously “everything but the kitchen sink”. Just throw in every tragic thing you can think of, it’s there. Just when you think something good might happen, nope. The tragedy gets almost repetitive and boring. Like, how many times do I want to read about wanting her father’s approval or about how cold her mother is? How many times do I want to read about her bloody clothes and the mud and men’s gaping wounds? How many times do I want to read about her drunken pill popping à la Valley of the Dolls? In a few cases, tragedy conveniently disposed of some plot points and characters which I found annoying. For instance, rather than Frankie having an honest conversation with another character, something traumatic occurs so she doesn’t have to. Do I get that the war trauma (both during and at home)was unending? Absolutely. That’s not really my issue. Kristin Hannah likes to pile on the tragedy and trauma in many of her books; it’s her formula and it gets tiresome after awhile. And the romance. Ugh, don’t get me started. I predicted basically what would happen every single time a love interest was introduced and I was right. She falls in love suddenly with no real reason other than feelings like “he brought her back to life”. Gag me. That’s not real, especially not after a 5 minute conversation. Why do any of these men deserve to be adored? I can’t see it. None of them were particularly stellar specimens. You can tell me these relationships were realistic all you want but I’m not obligated to like these guys or just gloss over the repeated adultery (that continues after the war). Hannah’s presentation of the romances is sentimental, cheesy and predictable. She does this in her books a lot. And I’m sorry but nothing will compel me to be ok with not one but two men coming back from the dead. This is a highly readable book and you’ll be turning the pages fast. I hope that we continue to hear more about underappreciated women in history (and this book did make me want to know more). However, I would have preferred less piled on tragedy and fewer contrived, sentimental plotlines. Pub date: Feb 6, 2024",3.0,neutral,The Women,127305853
"easiest 5 stars ever!!! it will be nearly IMPOSSIBLE for readers to not love this book. Kristin Hannah is BACK and she has done it again 👏🏼🙏🏼😭❤️ and to answer everyone’s question to me so far… THE NIGHTINGALE is my fave book of all time and therefore my favorite KH book. but… THE WOMEN is right beside it ❤️🙌🏼 a full review is over on my IG, but my quick thoughts: 💔 heartbreaking subject matter. very specific and real stories about The Vietnam War and also life post-war and what that was like for the Vets that returned home 📖 the pacing is on fire. the first half of the book has you flipping pages so fast—the action is page after page after page. it’s 450+ pages but moved QUICK—i finished in 24 hours and could have binged it in one sitting if i had the time 📖 Frankie is one of my fave MCs ever. she’s badass and flawed and tough and inspiring and emotional and an absolutely beautiful woman. she does some bad things but again, she is human and flawed and she is suffering 📖 the female friendships and themes in this book will make your heart so happy 📖 the research KH must have done for this book is INSANE. like so many other hisfic novels, it’s incredibly eye opening and educational. it shows you sides of the Vietnam War you probably have never seen or heard of before, and also brings things you have heard of to light in a very real way 📖 the ending will ruin you in the best way. the tears were definitely flowing but i wouldn’t have changed a single thing 😭❤️❤️❤️👏🏼 i cried the entire last 10 pages. each paragraph hit me harder than the one previously 🥹😂😭 📖 the love stories are very prevalent but try not to get caught up in them—it’s so much more than a woman and her love interests in her author’s note she mentions how long she’s wanted to write this book but how she wanted to build the courage and strength to do the story justice and boy oh boy did she ever. as someone (like so many others) with a very close family member who fought in Vietnam… this really hits close to home. so much of what is explained and illustrated in this book is what really happened in Vietnam and how some of the veterans really felt and it’s heartbreaking and an important story to be told. it makes me want to be able to call my relatives and talk about what they went through and relive those stories again with them, but they are now at peace 🙏🏼💔 THANK YOU to my friends at St Martins Press for gifting me this early. all opinions and thoughts as always are my own. i know we don’t want to wait until Feb 2024 to have this out in the world (i want to talk to everyone about it right now…), but i promise it will be WELL worth the wait. thank you, Kristin, for telling this story of The Women during the Vietnam War ❤️ *EDIT: adding in my fave quotes from the book! 🚨 potential spoilers ahead 🚨 ❤️❤️❤️ “Women can be heroes.” “No fear, McGrath. You can do this.” “Maybe happy now, happy for a moment, is all we really get. Happy forever seems like a shitload to ask in a world on fire.” “There are no women in Vietnam, dear.” “She needed to do as everyone suggested and forget.” “She was never exactly sure what she was ashamed of, jsut that she was weak, or had somehow done something bad, been a part of something bad, something no one wanted to talk about.” “We don’t really talk about it.” “The war no one wants to remember.” “Thank you for finally remembering us.” “You and me, McGrath. Finally.”",5.0,positive,The Women,127305853
"Women can be heroes. 4 1/2 stars. certainly knows how to take a sledgehammer to your heart and she is NOT afraid to do it. Hannah's reads are so powerful and harrowing that I can forgive a few negatives, like here I think the major plot points of the story are quite predictable-- yet they still hit me like a ton of bricks, their impact not lessened by the fact I'd seen them coming. Maybe this one was easier to predict as I'm getting used to the author's formula. Her novels take us to vastly different times and places but she uses similar tricks to engage the reader. I’m not complaining: it works. This book is an epic on women in the Vietnam War. Hannah introduces us to bright-eyed and naive nurse Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath, who longs for a place on her father's ""Hero's Wall"" and so volunteers for service in Vietnam. It is an understatement to say she didn't know what she was getting into. Frankie finds herself in hell on Earth, struggling to help put together men who have been blown apart, watching Vietnamese children die from napalm burns, losing friends for a cause none of them even understand. Those sensitive to graphic depictions of injuries should steer clear-- as a nurse in Vietnam, Frankie witnesses some of the most horrific things in our world. ""We've developed the skills to save their bodies, but not their lives,"" Captain Smith said. But this is not just a story about the war itself. It is a story of a young woman's growth, aging impossibly in a short amount of time. Her friends, Barb and Ethel, keep her spirits up at the worst times, and the funny dialogue between them is a major highlight of the novel. She falls in love and this, too, gives her hope for the future. How could she go from red alert sirens and saving lives to butter knives and champagne? Only half of this story is set in Vietnam; the other half is about coming home and living afterwards. It's not easy to say which one is more difficult. There was no hero's welcome for those returning from Vietnam. Veterans were cursed at and spat on. Many were left with irreparable damage from their time in the war. For some, it was the loss of a limb. For many, it was the loss of something harder to explain. While psychiatric help began to be offered, it was typically for male veterans. As with several of Hannah's other books, she once again shines a light on the women who have been erased from history. The female veterans she spoke with for this book told her how they often heard ""There were no women in Vietnam."" I cannot imagine how it must feel to risk your life, sacrifice your youth and peace of mind, and be told that it didn't even happen. Another horrible, ugly, powerful book from one of my must-read authors. As well as graphic injuries, this may not be suitable to those sensitive to depictions of substance abuse and miscarriage .",4.0,positive,The Women,127305853
"Hot Take: This book would never end The Women details Frances “Frankie” McGrath’s experience serving in the Vietnam War as a nurse. And her transition into civilian life. This book had no plot—it is based on one character. The problem is….Frankie isn’t likeable. She is an entitled, spoiled rich girl. She has everything handed to her, and her reason for going to war was to be on the hero’s wall and not wanting to work her way up at the hospital. Although she constantly pulls on her veteran roommates, she couldn’t be bothered to provide support to nurses that arrived after her. Apparently, she hasn’t heard of paying it forward. Hannah also never gets into what makes Frankie so unique, what makes her special, what drives her. What about her would the world miss if she was gone? My favorite author says it best: “Every sentence I write is surrounded by the ghosts of the sentences I could have written at that point but chose not to.” In The Women, I wanted to hear about the other servicewomen. After Part 1, it was time to transition to someone else. How did Major Goldstein, the chief nurse, get to her position and how did she cope with placing the nurses, determining their fates? Why didn’t we shift to Ethel and Barb and what happened before Frankie? Additionally, Hannah is far too verbose, leaving the reader to wade through needless paragraphs, inserting uninteresting details. Sorry, I just don’t care about the cheap motel especially at the end of the book. Not sorry. The foreshadowing is so heavy that the book becomes predictable, and there are far too many characters—all of them are undeveloped. The author did far too much telling instead of showing. Show us memories of Finley and Frances. Give us the backstory on Ethel and Barb. Don’t tell us. Show us. Although I greatly enjoyed learning more about the brave women who valiantly served our country, this book was a chore to read. *Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion.

"2 soap opera stars. Too cutesy and romance focused. No one is more surprised (and disappointed) than me to be giving a 2 star rating for this much loved and highly anticipated book. I started this novel thinking it would be an easy 5 star read. My rating quickly lowered to 3 stars by the halfway mark and then slowly dwindled down to 2 stars by the end. This novel follows a young womans harrowing journey as a nurse in the Vietnam war. The main character was likeable enough, but she lacked any sort of grit or believability for me. She felt very surface level and cutesy from start to finish, giving the overall tone a soap opera feel. Unfortunately I do not enjoy cute stories, especially when it comes to historical fiction. The lighter tone of this novel made it easy to fly through but neglected to leave any sort of lasting impression on me (other than disappointment). When I read historical fiction, I want grit, heaviness, atmosphere, rip-my-heart-out emotions along with the factual detail. The only aspect I received from this novel was the educational component of learning about this time in history. It had some atmosphere , but my detachment from the characters had me distanced from the plot altogether. There was no grit or emotion to pull me in. There were a couple of heart wrenching moments, but they didn’t truly move or impact me in any way. Romance is a heavy theme throughout this book. Unfortunately romance is a genre I do not enjoy reading. The main characters’ love interests had me confused and distanced from the storyline as none of it was even remotely believable. I think most of my lack of connection is that I wasn’t bought into any of the romance pieces and this is an integral part of what makes the storyline work. I also found this book extremely predictable and very cheesy at times. My eyes rolled a lot in the second half. I predicted several large plot points in the second half which took away any sort of shock factor or enjoyment I may have received from those reveals. The author also included an extreme amount of hot topics, like she was trying to touch on too many things without truly fleshing her ideas out. Overall, this was a complete miss for me. I am thankful to have read it solely for learning about this time period but I received zero enjoyment from an entertainment perspective. I have loved all of this authors previous historical fiction work, so if you are looking for a gritty, heavy, impactful historical fiction book, I encourage you to read those before picking this up. Please note, I am the outlier with my thoughts so make sure to read the countless raving reviews before deciding on this one.",2.0,negative,The Women,127305853
"4.5 ⭐️!! I love a book about strong women, especially one written by Kristin Hannah and ESPECIALLY about ones who served our country and were told to their faces that there were “no women in Vietnam” (but still persevered) Frankie is one of my favorite FMC of Kristin Hannah’s, we see her in the beginning blindly and naively joining the nurses in the midst of the Vietnam war, then watched her become so strong while seeing so much loss. Not just that, but how she coped coming home when no one would listen to her or validate her which was so heartbreaking and frustrating…it was all such a JOURNEY!! The pacing was so quick with always something happening which kept me super invested from the beginning The storyline & ending became a bit predictable, but I appreciated the realistic depiction of women in the war & the female relationships Frankie made!",4.0,positive,The Women,127305853

"I have a beautiful big paper arc written by a writer whom I've never read before, but I know she is a NYT bestselling author, and that her books are deeply loved. I open the book. The first sentence is: The walled and gated MacGrath estate was a world unto itself, protected and private. And I think: Gosh, isn't this a slightly uninspired way to begin a book, I mean, couldn't she have tried a little harder than to call something ""a world unto itself,"" which was probably a little on the clichéd side even before the first time anyone wrote it down? Ok, moving on, the next two sentences are: On this twilit evening, the Tudor-style home's mullioned windows glowed jewel-like amid the lush, landscaped grounds. Palm fronds swayed overhead... and okay okay that's enough, because my brain is saying: ""On this twilit evening?"" ""windows glowed?""...""Palm fronds swayed ?"" I'm just talking about my own experience, here. Speaking solely from my own point of view, this writing makes me feel bored and irritable at the same time. It feels so bland. It's as if someone is slapping me with wet cardboard. It's not exactly hurting me but I want to get away from it. But: Should I care so much about the prose style? Because, maybe it's a good story. But I do care. I want to read a story that is written with care. So, most people would keep reading for several more pages at least, even if they felt the same way about these first sentences--I mean, can you really tell anything at all from two or three sentences?--but for me I'm already thinking that, if this is how a book begins--if the beginning is, indeed, the place where a writer must capture my attention--then I'm done. And this is normally where I would put a book down. But this time, because I've heard so much about this writer's books, I open a few pages at random, just to see if I can find just one sentence to fall in love with, anywhere, or some phrase, at least, that catches my eye. And I read: Frankie felt a heaviness in her heart, a sorrow that she knew would stay with her... Jamie was there instantly, holding her steady. She reached for his hand, held it, not daring to look at him... She looked up in surprise... He shrugged, as unable to find the words as he'd been to process the grief... He looked at her a long moment... That's all I have to say about this book, except to add that clearly I am way, way an outlier on why I read, which is at least 90% for the sound of the language, for the jolt of reading a sentence that is both describing something completely familiar to my human experience and at the same time is said in a completely new and revelatory way, and whenever I begin a book that does not do these things, both of them simultaneously, I think of all the books waiting to be read, and I move on.",,,The Women,127305853

"Eeeek. This will undoubtedly be one of my most disappointing reads of '24! I am baffled by all the 5 star ratings that it's getting. After ""The Nightingale"" and ""Four Winds,"" both of which were 5 star reads for me, I was really looking forward to ""The Women."" I started it immediately the day it was released. I was excited, to say the least. But ugh. The premise: Frankie McGrath is not your traditional girl, wanting more out of life than the traditional domestic roles. When the U.S. goes to war in Vietnam, her brother Finley, who is also her best friend, enlists and her parents are brimming with pride. Her father came from a ""Navy house"" and has a ""hero wall"" in their home where he puts up pictures of ""heroes."" His father was a veteran, and his own generation of men all went to war during WWII, but he was not able to go and overcompensated for his subsequent feelings of inadequacy by going overboard on the patriotism. His children are raised believing that serving your country is the highest honor. So when her brother Finley enlists & is deployed, it occurs to Frankie that as an R.N., she should follow in his footsteps. She winds up joining the army bc it's the only military branch that will accept her fresh out of college with no experience, she envisions proud parents, meeting up with her brother in 'Nam, coming home to accolades and a heroes welcome. Reality is nothing even close to that. So it started off alright. I am not particularly knowledgable about the Vietnam War so I figured I'd learn a thing or two. Things escalate quickly. Before Frankie's plane even lands in Vietnam, she's getting shot at by ""Charlie"" & cowering in fear bc of all the loud, terrifying gunshots & explosions happening in the vicinity. She's quickly thrust into wartime nursing, exposed to death, missing limbs, & other horrific injuries within minutes of reporting for duty. There is no learning curve, there is no training, she's forced to sac up & buckle down & WORK. So this was as far as I got while still thinking that I would enjoy this. At this point, things started to go awry. Although the first strange thing I took note of was the lack of response when Frankie finds out that her brother had been killed in action & there were no remains. This was supposed to be her best friend and only sibling, the reason why she enlisted, the closest person in the world to her, yet her reaction to his death felt bizarrely un reactive. Her family gets a letter, she's sad, takes a melancholy walk on the beach & that's basically it. For the way their relationship was depicted, the response felt disproportionately mild. I dismissed it as just a weird thing & would have been willing to overlook it had Hannah not proceeded to do the same thing over & over. And from this point on it's just one cliche after another. Enormous things happen abruptly and in a matter of a few pages. Frankie's responses are meager & fleeting. The fact that she enlisted for her brother & then lost him before being deployed is rarely mentioned, & when it is it's secondary & superficial, nothing but a quick opportunity to reinforce the supposed narrative that losing her brother actually meant something to her & wasn’t just some inconsequential event like it seems. Frankie gets to Vietnam & initially is seemingly shellshocked, but by the end of the night she's thinking about the dreamy MARRIED doctor with the ""sad eyes"" that whispered cliched reassurances & sweet nothings in her ear like ""Don't worry, I got you. You're safe."" She falls in love in a matter of a couple pages after a few of the most cliched wartime interactions ever, & then oops, he dies too. We got a page or two full of shrieking ""SAVE HIM!"" followed by obligatory sad moment w/her friends, but a few pages later there's a new guy whispering similar cliched things in her ear that make her weak with lust. It's instalovey to the extreme. The whole story moves along at breakneck speed, despite being mostly devoid of plot, with Frankie moving through experience after experience with banal, paltry one page responses, which ultimately just makes it all a bunch of stuff that happened to her that l didn’t really care about. Kristin Hannah just never gives us time to care. None of the other characters in the book have any depth whatsoever, they're all cardboard cutouts, stereotypical renderings of best friends & wartime lovers. Even the most heartbreaking parts of the story were rendered unfeeling because of how quickly they were moved through. There are various deaths & descriptions of soldiers/villagers last moments, at one point a baby is brought in that's covered in head to toe burns, barely alive, having been found in the arms of her dead mother. She takes her last breath in Frankie’s arms, & not even a page later it's on to the next thing. Which to be fair, one might defend by saying that’s just the life of a military nurse, where days go by w/lightening speed & there’s no time for despair. Which might very well be the case, but then it’s essentially just someone saying, “a baby came in with burns all over its body & died."" Yes, that’s very sad, but such quick descriptions hardly evoke strong emotional responses. A humanization needs to take place in order for me to extend any significant amount of empathy, most especially when what we’re reading is fiction. The after the war half of the book was no better. Again Frankie moves through event after event, phase after phase with minimal depth. She comes home from war expecting elated parents & a revered veteran's welcome only to find that an entire country has changed it's outlook on the war—her own parents were so ashamed that they'd concealed the truth & claimed she was studying abroad. Frankie tries to settle in. She moves thru the expected war responses one right after another, the behavior stereotypical & cursory, the healing process offensively unrealistic. (There's mention of bad dreams. At a party a firework goes off & she dives under a table & shrieks for everyone to take cover, etc etc) Eventually enter man #3 that more or less ""saves her.” She gets pregnant & then is spontaneously (but temporarily) healed. More of the typical women’s-problems-can-be-cured-by-marriage-and-a-baby-mentality, wow it can even cure PTSD!! But wait, oh no, man #2 that she thought was dead makes a stunning reappearance & she loses the baby from the shock of it. At this point all her PTSD symptoms reemerge with a vengeance, bc of course things didn’t get really bad till there was a man involved. She realizes he’s married to someone else, which naturally causes her PTSD to escalate from something she had a solid grasp on to full blown PTSD with depression and suicidal ideation, and from there to an actual suicide attempt, which is proceeded by magically healing via get this...getting a place of her own in a location with wide open spaces. (Insert eyeroll here) Maybe if I had liked Frankie, like at all, I would have cared more about what happened to her but I just couldn't get there. A self proclaimed ""good girl,"" Frankie pretty much immediately falls into an entanglement with a married man. Her pathetic attempt at resistance felt almost like she was being coy more than it felt like she was experiencing any moral quandary. I know, I know, they're at war! It's a tale as old as war itself, the idea of a wartime dalliance, when the normal rules don't apply & the lives & wives waiting thousand of miles away back at home are inconsequential in the midst of a war where any minute could be one's last. I understand the logic but it’s still hard for me to wrap my brain around, bc personally I can’t imagine wanting to spend my final moments on this earth being unfaithful to the man I love, but yeah ok, I can acknowledge that I don’t know what any of that truly feels like, but Frankie’s dithering protestations were just so pathetic & absurdly fake, I couldn’t even try to believe it. Especially considering she basically does the same thing not once, but TWICE. And we’re supposed to believe she’s struggling with attractions to unavailable men that are just so fierce that they are downright unconquerable?! Pffff. ""But...But... I'm a good girl!!"" No girlfriend, you are not, not when you're knowingly f'ing with married men. It's really not that hard to not, I've come across plenty of married men that I have found attractive, but their marriage status is like turning off a switch. I won't go there, so everything else is irrelevant. I do not indulge the attraction. It’s pretty simple. In Frankie's case, she had no real principles despite believing that she did. She was a selfish, self absorbed simp, a supposed feminist who wanted something different, or more than the traditional domestic life, yet all she did from beginning to end is was fall all over herself for sexy men. I'm sure there are a lot of Kristin Hannah devotees who enjoy and specifically seek her out for her personal brand of romance. Nightingale was romance heavy as well, but its steady pacing & other separate, unrelated plots made it all easier to get on board with bc it wasn't the only relevant storyline. And while in ""The Women,' the romances didn’t exactly impel the nonexistent plot to it’s end, it was all still essentially a romance with a Vietnam War setting. The best bits IMO were the bits about the friendships Frankie made while nursing. Going through something as traumatizing as a war together has a way of solidifying relationships & bringing people much closer together than the average friendship. The way that Frankie relied on them & the way they showed up for her time & time again warmed my heart, but tbh even these parts highlighted how lacking the whole book was bc again, they lacked any substantial characterizations. We got no real backstories on either of the women, even the bits & pieces of their present lives were quickly glossed over. They were props, devices plugged in just to get Frankie out of whatever man-induced hole she was currently in. It also validated my opinion about Frankie being self absorbed & selfish, for all the support & love she’s given by these women, she gave almost none of it herself. For example, it takes her a very long time to be open minded about the cause her “best friend” has devoted her life to bc she’s too busy wallowing, & then when one of them gets engaged Frankie is jealous. Everything ties back to whatever is going on in her love life, it was annoying. For a book titled ""The Women” which supposedly was intended to be something that gave distinction & a voice to a group that history has all but forgotten, a lot of this was about the men. Historical fiction is not my favorite genre, but when written well (according to my preferences) they can still be some of my favorite books. But when I pick up a piece of historical fiction, I want to learn something about a time or a place or a people. Often after or while reading HF I find myself reading up on that topic, watching documentaries, searching out facts. Kate Quinn, John Boyne, Emma Donoghue are a few that come to mind that have consistently provided me with what I want in my historical fiction. What I don’t want is to read a romance within a historical setting. In “The Women,” reading about the experiences of a nurse in a time of war DID interest me, but it could have just as easily been any other place or time or war. Other than a few mentions of the heat & of “Charlie” one would hardly be able to differentiate between this & any other wars. It was ultimately a hollow construction of the war, a backdrop for the romantic exploits of our MC. I could have written this book with what little I knew about the Vietnam war. I got through just shy of 500 pages without learning a single thing. The title “Love In A Time Of War” would have mo To be fair, I didn’t completely despise this book, it was readable, I was never bored . It was just that I had such high expectations & the result was disappointing. I have not read any of Kristin Hannah’s earlier works to know firsthand whether this is actually true or not, but I had gotten the sense that she had begun to deviate a bit from her previous chick-lit/romance with more literary work with ""Nightingale,"" and ""Four Winds,"" but it feels like she’s reverted back to her former M.O. with ""The Women."" (Which no shame to readers of chick-lit, some of it is great, but it’s just not what I was looking for in this instance.) Ordinarily I might have rated this 3 stars, but because my disappointment was so severe I had to go with 2. That doesn't mean that I'm giving up on Kristin Hannah, I still plan to one day read the ""Great Alone,"" and I will likely continue to read whatever she comes out with. It is also worth noting that so far the reaction to “The Women”has been so positive that it leaves me feeling like I might be alone in my feelings about it. I’m getting the typical “what did I miss?!” feeling. To each their own I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️",2.0,negative,The Women,127305853
"***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY - ONE OF MY TOP 5 BOOKS OF 2023 *** There have been books written about some things that occurred in the 60’s – the music, the activism, the “summer of love”, the protests over the war, but this is the first book that I’ve read that has touched my heart so deeply. If not for a high lottery number, my husband would have been one of the thousands of young men who fought in this senseless war. Women have been largely ignored in most wars and it seems the same was the case in the Vietnam War (the Vietnamese called it the American war). The government misinformed the public about so much, including the fact that WOMEN WERE THERE TOO! Frankie McGrath’s brother has just enlisted and she decides to follow him, she enlists in the Army. Just out of nursing school and only 20 years old, she has no idea what to expect. She had lived a sheltered life on Coronado island, her parents were well off and she had an idyllic childhood. Once in Vietnam she is thrust into taking care of severely wounded men, horrible living conditions and a lack of trained staff. She is unprepared for what is ahead. She will not only learn nursing in extreme conditions but eventually taught how to do surgical procedures. Her base camp had one doctor and three nurses along with medics to care for the hundreds of injured men. Frankie came to dread the sound of helicopters approaching!! She is fortunate to have incredible roommates who will be her friends for life. She learns love and heartache, loss, anger and frustration. Upon returning home, there is no welcome, not even from her parents. After all of the parades and sit-ins to protest the war, no one seems to want to SEE THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY. Eventually with lots of help Frankie carves out a life. She had to hit rock bottom before she got help. She struggled with PTSD, depression, alcoholism and betrayal on her path to a new life. The author states that this was a book that she had wanted to write for a long time. I applaud you Ms. Hannah for putting your heart and incredible research into this book. “Women can be heroes too” – and they so often are even though their voices aren’t always heard. I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.",5.0,positive,The Women,127305853
"I love books that not only teach me something but are thought provoking and evoke emotion. This book fits that bill to a ""T"" and then some. I don't think it is possible for Kristin Hannah to write a bad book. As with her other books, is well written, well thought out, and gripping. I was instantly absorbed in this book and had a hard time putting it down. I felt as if I were a fly on the wall, traveling to Vietnam with Frankie, and observing what life as a nurse was like during that time. The devastating injuries of the soldiers, the choices the medical staff had to make (who could be saved, who not to treat), the explosions, the living conditions, the lack of supplies and the relationships that were formed, left an impression on me. Frances “Frankie” McGrath was raised Coronado Island, California by her conservative parents. In the beginning of the book, she is a twenty-year-old nursing student living at home with her conservative, country club member parents. After her older brother goes to Vietnam, Frankie recalls the words of one of his friends “Women can be heroes, too.” , Frankie joins the Army Nurse Corps and after training, she is sent to Vietnam to work as a nurse. What she sees and experiences is shocking, traumatizing, heartbreaking and ultimately life changing. When not treating the horrifically injured soldiers, Frankie has formed close bonds with her fellow nurses. Bonds that will also change her life. Upon coming home, Frankie is shocked by being spit on, yelled at, and told repeatedly that women were not in Vietnam. I was shocked to learn that the Nurses who provide medical care to soldiers were not considered Veterans even though they signed up with the Army. That they could not go to the VA for help with PTSD. It was appalling and heartbreaking. Besides the beautiful writing, I loved how Hannah showed the strength of female friendship. How the women supported each other and formed a family unit amongst themselves. This was one of the highlights for me. They lifted each other up, loved each other, accepted each other’s faults, celebrated their strengths, and when everyone else was letting them down, they knew they could count on each other. This book also shows how PTSD affected nurses, doctors, and soldiers. How many self-medicated with drugs and alcohol. This book also depicts scenes of great bravery, political upheaval, war protests, the effects of PTSD, self-medication with drugs, friendships, family dynamics, sexism, and growth. The characters are fully fleshed out and feel real. I felt for them, rooted for them, and cried with them. Well written, gripping, shocking, and thought provoking. *Traveling Friends buddy read with Mary Beth #KristinHannah #NetGalley #StMartinsPress Thank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

"When Frances ""Frankie McGrath's brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path when she hears that women can be heroes too. Frankie is overwhelmed by the chaos and destruction of war as well as the unexpected trauma of coming home to a changed and politically divided America. Every time I open up a Kristin Hannah novel I get so excited. I have loved all of her books. This story is all about the women, the nurses in the Vietnam War. I think this is the first book that actually is about the women in the Vietnam War. It's about the women who puts themselves in harms way to help others. Women whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has all too often been forgotten. It's an emotional story. Frankie is so brave and strong and has dealt with so much death. Many of the women ended up with PTSD, flashbacks, and nightmares but they couldn't get the help that was needed like the men could. I loved all of the characters. They were all done so well. I loved the women's friendship. They all had each other's backs. They all were a good support group with each other. This was such a great book. I want to thank St. Martin's Press for the copy of this book.",5.0,positive,The Women,127305853
"I really wanted to love this but it's the same white American savior view of the Vietnam War that we’ve seen many times before. Despite some well-researched details, Kristin Hannah doesn’t seem to care as much about historical or cultural accuracy when it comes to writing Vietnam or Vietnamese people. It feels as if Hannah's research stopped at looking up stock images of Vietnam. Nothing too egregious but it definitely took me out of the story and created many eyeroll moments. (For example, Hannah assumed Vietnamese women only wore áo dài for every situation - working in the fields, carrying baskets of fruits, serving Jack Daniels in an American bar - they didn't.) The fast pace and melodramatic turn of events also force the characters to remain one-dimensional and rush the natural development and chemistry of Frankie's friendships and relationships. The ""telling instead of showing"" writing style is also not for me, so I had no reason to finish this sadly. *updated Feb 2024",1.0,negative,The Women,127305853
"The Women was divine. Hannah’s writing has matured much like a fine wine. Each of her stories becoming richer, more complex, multi-layered. The Women is a tribute to the many unsung female nurses who served in the Vietnam War. Frankie, 20, has graduated nursing school and has enlisted. Although green, her nursing skills sharpen during her 2 tours. However when she returns home, the welcome isn’t a warm one. The brevity and courage these veterans had. Not only fighting for their lives over seas, but fighting for their own recognition at home amid a storm of protests and division. The sacrifices made. The lies told. Hannah masterly develops a character from a young naive girl, to a professional combat nurse, to a veteran returning home experiencing many of the symptoms men did- except many unaware women even served. Grief, PTSD, shame, addiction and healing. 5⭐️ Hannah, you knocked it out of the park.",5.0,positive,The Women,127305853
"The Women by Kristin Hannah is a Blend of Historical, Literary, and Women's Fiction! I'll be honest, I was expecting more finesse from Kristan Hannah's writing style and storytelling... The Women transports the reader, along with the main character, Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath, to the Thirty-Sixth Evac Hospital in Vietnam, sixty miles from Saigon, within the first four chapters. By the end of the sixth chapter, I shed my first tears. This is an emotional read and, for those of us who remember those years during the Vietnam War, it stirs different memories in each of us... Overall, the pace of this story is slow, allowing repetition to sneak in. This is especially true after Frankie's return from Vietnam. Her homecoming was heart-wrenching but carried on, chapter after chapter, making the story too long. Perhaps the length would have been better justified if backstories were included for the primary characters. Very little to nothing was provided for any of them. Early in, the writing felt cumbersome and overly descriptive with flowery prose. The narration sounded throaty, stilted, sometimes monotone, and at other times exaggerated. The story had more telling than showing by the author's use of the story's narrative, rather than focusing on creative writing skills to allow the story to flow naturally. The writing style was my least favorite aspect of this book. It felt clumsy, overdramatic, and at times, snarky. This was an immersion read with a Kindle copy and an Audible audiobook, narrated by Julia Whelan. I love the female-focused premise and how the author allows the reader's imagination to proceed beyond the ending of the story. The story is emotional, true to the era, and well-researched. I cried, relived the memories and the music from that time, and appreciated the feeling of authenticity. The Women has many positive reviews and high ratings and I respect those viewpoints. As in all of my reviews, this critique is my honest opinion. Outlier Island, here I come. It's going to be a lonely place this time around... 2⭐",2.0,negative,The Women,127305853

I've only read a few KH books now, but... and maybe it's just me, but it seems the two war books I've read from her are so heavy on the foreshadowing that the story becomes predictable. I always chalked it up to the fact that I'd read too many WWII stories. And maybe that's true as well, but this did seem foreshadow heavy to me. I was not a fan of Frankie's POV. At all. There was a lot of romantic entanglements in this one. More than I really care to have in a historical fiction. Frankie was super boy crazy and made the worst decisions ever. If you typically enjoy Kristin Hannah books, it's worth the read.

I for one hadn’t thought about the people who went there as nurses or other professions to help any way they could. I knew how important the war was when it came to recognizing how trauma can stay in the body and wreak havoc, and this book also showed how much society can make it harder to heal by not recognizing people who partake in war. In addition to being a convincing portrayal of war and PTSD, it was a love story that made me cry at the end.

"Another fantastic book by Kristin Hannah I haven’t read much about the Vietnam War.. but, I was born in ‘58 and as a young girl I remember seeing the horrific video and images on the nightly news and.. fortunately for me.. I only knew of one older cousin who got drafted to go to war. Most everything we saw before, during, and after the war was about the men who were there.. of course it was the men who saw combat.. but women were there too… the nurses trying to patch up mutilated bodies, being alongside the dying as they took their last breaths..the women also endured a lot! This is the story of the WOMEN… a few of them.. mostly about a young girl Frankie, who after her brother enlisted.. she followed him and was a war nurse in the Army. I loved the story, mostly the first half that took place in Vietnam during wartime.

"“The women had a story to tell, even if the world wasn’t quite yet ready to hear it, and their story began with three simple words. We were there.” The Women by Kristin Hannah follows twenty-one-year-old Frances “Frankie” Grace McGrath, a sheltered young woman from an affluent family, who enlisted as a nurse during the Vietnam War. The narrative follows Frankie through the years of the war and the decades that follow. There is a lot to like about this novel. The author writes with compassion and the narrative flows well. The fact that the author wanted to tell the story of the women who served in the Vietnam War, giving those whose contributions have been ignored a voice, renders this novel remarkable in its scope and intention. I loved how the author describes the camaraderie between friends and colleagues, their support for one another, the resilience, compassion and bravery of the women who served and the sacrifices they made. I also liked how the author incorporated the public outcry and protests back home - the mixed feelings about the war and those who served and the politics of the time - into the narrative. The author’s unflinching depiction of PTSD and how so many people could not find the help they needed to cope with the trauma they carried back home was heartbreaking was realistic and thought-provoking as were the descriptions of the horrors of war (some of which were more than a little difficult to read). Despite the story being set in years of the Vietnam War and its aftermath, the issues that she has raised are both crucial and relevant even in today’s world. Unfortunately, there are a few issues that prevent me from giving this novel a higher rating. I was invested in Frankie’s journey and was eager to see how she evolved from a privileged young woman whose sheltered upbringing could not have prepared her for what she would have to endure. The weak character development, the focus on her love life, and the stereotypical and slightly disrespectful representation of the men (with whom she gets romantically involved) who serve their country did not make for pleasant reading and detracted from the overall experience. The ending was poignant, but again, the author’s choice to provide a “happy” (melodramatic) ending lessened the overall impact. Both Ethel and Barb were well thought out characters ( in fact, I found them more interesting than Frankie). Though we do get to know their stories in segments interspersed throughout the novel, mostly through Frankie’s interactions with them, I feel the author has missed an opportunity to further enrich the narrative. In my humble opinion, focusing on one woman’s perspective and relegating the other characters to supporting roles, defeats the purpose of this novel. All three women, each with their distinct convictions and motivations, deserved to have their voices woven into the narrative. The perspectives of all three of these women from diverse backgrounds, each of whom embark on their respective journeys facing their own set of challenges, would have provided much-needed depth to the narrative. Given the strong historical context and the premise of the novel, I’d expected to enjoy this novel more than I actually did. Overall, while l did not dislike The Women, I can’t help feeling a tad disappointed with certain aspects of the story. However, many have enjoyed this novel more and I would request you to read those reviews before deciding on whether to read this one.

"4.5 stars rounded up. I was I high school when the Vietnam War started and I have to admit that I didn’t pay much attention until several years later in college when I found myself in a protest march on campus. I was more aware then or at least I thought I was. I had learned that a high school friend was killed there. The focus then was on the young men killed, the innocents of the region bombed, the insanity of the war. I never gave a thought about the women who served in the military as nurses, who saved so many, who experienced the trauma of seeing mutilated bodies, held the hands of those who wouldn’t come home. I never thought of the nurses who worked tirelessly under horrible conditions, who through their stamina and skill made it possible for so many to come home. Had I thought about them I never would have imagined that they would not be considered veterans. Kristin Hannah in this novel though the character of Frankie McGrath and her two best friends brings light and honor to the women who served. It’s a stunning read, not for the faint of heart, with vivid descriptions of the wounds and loss of limbs and loss of life. It portrays the grueling days and nights of these women as well as the doctors vividly. Their physical and emotional exhaustion and how they cope with sometimes heartbreaking effect. Frankie’s life after she returned home is heart wrenching. Highly recommend for those who remember the times and for those who don’t. It’s an eye opener that will punch you in the gut, but it’s worth it. I received a copy of this book from St. Martin’s Press through NetGalley.",5.0,positive,The Women,127305853
".·:*¨ 4.25 stars ¨*:·. in typical kristin hannah fashion, this book was equally devastating + addicting. you know those books you could universally recommend to anyone despite their age, genre taste, and personality? this is one of those. ≪•◦ ❈ she’d begun believing that she was stupid and learned slowly that she was just human. ❈ ◦•≫ ╭┈┈what to expect┈┈╮ ・❥・an army nurse’s POV during her service in the Vietnam war ・❥・an in-depth look into America as it was protesting the Vietnam war and veterans were coming home to a divided America ・❥・PTSD, love + loss, alcohol/substance abuse, depression, intense war descriptions (somewhat explicit injury scenes during war) – AKA lots of emotional turmoil ・❥・familial misunderstanding, love, forgiveness, and hurt ・❥・ a woman losing herself, finding herself, and then doing it all over again and again ・❥・an absolute emotional ROLLERCOASTER ・❥・ strong female friendships <3 (no one writes these better than kristin hannah!) ≪•◦ ❈ maybe happy now, happy for a moment, is all we really get. happy forever seems a shitload to ask in a world on fire. ❈ ◦•≫ this was honestly such a heavy read (i was also on my period, so that didn’t help) and it made me emotional multiple times. this author is one of the few that i can count on to upend my emotions every single time because her characters just feel so HUMAN. they are imperfect, make mistakes, struggle, and then find happiness where they can. this isn’t my favorite book by her (‘firefly lane’ is a 6 star and absolutely destroyed me)... but take that with a grain of salt PLEASE. i don’t give out 4+ star ratings lightly and kristin hannah continues to deliver every time. her books make me enjoy historical fiction without ever getting bored or being overwhelmed from excessive info dumping. this one will sit on my shelf for a very long time and it’s one i’d recommend to literally anyone. ⋆ ★",4.0,positive,The Women,127305853
"Five stars with a minor quibble It’s a fine art to write a story that immediately immerses the reader in a different world. Once again, Hannah has done it with The Women. I felt I was right there with Frankie, a new nurse in Vietnam. My heart was beating just as quickly as hers, feeling just as helpless, questioning the decision that brought her there. She’s quickly forced out of her comfort zone, having to take on responsibilities she never imagined. Hannah gets the immediacy of the relationships, how quickly they become deep. But just as quickly dear friends are gone, hopefully because they’ve fulfilled their obligations. Other times, because they’ve died. I hadn’t realized how few of the nurses in Vietnam were women. She is one of only nine female nurses at the triage hospital where she’s initially sent. I also hadn’t realized how their very presence in Vietnam was denied. Frankie is repeatedly told “there were no women in Vietnam”. The second half of the story tackles Frankie’s return to the States. Again, Hannah does a great job presenting the PTSD, the failure to recognize her service, the protests, especially the Veteran protests. My one quibble was that the romance part of the story started coming across as more soap opera than real. This one grabbed me and never let me go. I was finding all sorts of reasons to continue to read/listen to this. I finished this 15 hour book in two days. The story is incredibly well researched. Right down to the little things, like nurses not being allowed to wear pantyhose with their dress uniform but forced to wear a girdle and hose. Or how prevalent rats were. I am curious to know if studies back up the idea that the Vietnam vets suffered more PTSD because their service, unlike other war time vets, was not acknowledged - that they weren’t lauded when they returned home, that they were forced to keep silent about their experiences. The audio book was narrated by Julia Whelan who did a fabulous job. She truly enhanced the story. My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press and Macmillan Audio for an advance copy of this book.",5.0,positive,The Women,127305853
"Kristin Hannah's upcoming release, The Women, left me in a severe love-hate conundrum. I can only give it three stars, an average of the five stars it deserves for the parts set in Vietnam and the one star it deserves for the backstories and romances. I loved the section of the book set in Vietnam. This part of the book was well-researched, action-packed, and took me as close as I wanted to be to a combat medical evacuation unit. Vietnam War literature has not covered the nurse's perspective much, so I especially valued this content. The Vietnam writing was gritty and sometimes challenging to read but written very well (trigger warnings for some readers, though, so be forewarned). However, the book chapters preceding Frankie's tour in Vietnam were slow and plodding. Frankie seemed devoid of personality - a cardboard caricature of ""the good girl."" I came close to DNFing the book before it even took off. The last half of this overly long book covered Frankie's return home and her struggles with PTSD. Aspects of these sections had decent content, covering the abysmal treatment of returning vets, the complete dismissal of women serving in combat zones, and the range of issues Vietnam Vets had adapting to life back home. All good, but then there were the intertwined romances and backstories, and these were, in my opinion, just horrible. I've watched soap operas with more feasible plot lines. I don't want to include spoilers, but there were way too many times I rolled my eyes in dismay. It wasn't even that the romance aspect was too swoony (people familiar with my reviews know I have a low tolerance for swooniness), but the plot devolved into the ludicrous. The ridiculousness of some of the events in Frankie's relationships detracted from the seriousness of the rest of the story. Given the book was almost 500 pages long, much of this could have (should have) been edited out. Some details in the book's second half would have benefitted from better research. As written, they detracted from the good parts of the story and came off as just plain lazy. It's small stuff, but it piled up and was sometimes so frustrating I wanted to give up reading. Here are a few of my issues (that won't give away the plot). First, one nurse friend wants to be a veterinarian. OK, good for her, but in the late 1960s, few women were getting into vet school and, indeed, were mostly blocked from becoming large animal vets as this woman aspired to (I am a veterinarian, and vet school did not open broadly to women until the early 1980s). So this friend comes home from her tour in, I think, March and enrolls in vet school during the middle of the school year because, of course, a nurse can just do that without taking any prerequisites or entrance exams or even applying. Then this same friend, more than once, drops everything, including vet school, to fly out at the last minute and spend weeks helping Frankie, who is dealing with one melodramatic romantic crisis after another. Because you can do that in the middle of vet school with no apparent repercussions. This isn't the vet school I remember. And what regular folks just flew around the country on a whim in the 1960s? Flying was a big deal then, not done on a day's notice. Later in the book, a character living in rural Montana decides to become a clinical psychologist and does so while living in rural Montana because they have so many clinical psychology programs (yes, this is sarcasm). I understand I am an outlier here, but I'm also not alone in my criticisms of the non-Vietnam aspects of the novel. You'll enjoy the book if melodrama, lack of historical accuracy, and telenovela-level romances don't bother you. Thanks to NetGalley for providing me with an eBook version of the novel in return for a review.",3.0,neutral,The Women,127305853
"Saccharine sweet drivel. Like a Hallmark movie with the tear-jerkers amped up to one million. Seriously. This was every single steaming Vietnam veteran stereotype and 1960s cliche shat into a heaping pile of excrement and left to chill overnight. Stinky and unpleasantly cold and squishy when you try to pick it up the next morning. The writing is shit. All tell, absolutely no show. The foreshadowing is a constant palm strike to the face. It is trying way too hard to be legit, and it's super duper obvious Hannah is not a vet, because while she did a shit ton of research and wants the reader to know that, there are small things that are just...obnoxiously bad. If you want to read about women serving in Vietnam and are dying to read a fiction book and not one of the handful (so few!) memoirs, do yourself a favor and read * instead. Here are nonfiction books about military women in Vietnam I recommend instead of this book: *I think one of the reasons I'm SO salty about this book is because it kinda rips off the plot of The Road Home (the basics, anyways). Like, I cannot tell you how few original ideas The Women contains. When I say that it has every single Vietnam War stereotype in existence mashed into one book, I am not lying, served with a heaping side of white saviorism.",1.0,negative,The Women,127305853
"“The women had a story to tell, even if the world wasn't quite yet ready to hear it, and their story began with three simple words. We were there.” Kristen Hannah is quickly becoming my favorite author. This is my third book by her and she is a wonderful storyteller. She knows how to captivate her audience. “That was the starting and ending point in life: love. The journey was everything in between.” In The Women you follow Frankie who is combat nurse durning The Vietnam War. She tells her story about her time before and after the war. “Thank God for girlfriends. In this crazy, chaotic, divided world that was run by men, you could count on the women.” I LOVED this book so much. I learned so much about the Vietnam War. Kristen had me googling info like I was back in High School and honestly I loved it. This book is more than just a war story. It captures female friendships, ptsd representation a world we used to live in not too long ago. I loved how much music was mentioned in this book as well. That time era I think had the best Rock N Roll so I loved to see it get the recognition it deserved. I have like 300 quotes from this book that will stay with me for a lifetime. “Maybe happy now, happy for a moment, is all we really get. Happy forever seems a shitload to ask in a world on fire.” The Nightingale- 4.5 ⭐️ The Great Alone- 5 ⭐️ The Women- 5 ⭐️ “We were the last believers, my generation. We trusted what our parents taught us about right and wrong, good and evil, the American myth of equality and justice and honor. I wonder if any generation will ever believe again. People will say it was the war that shattered our lives and laid bare the beautiful lie we’d been taught. And they’d be right. And wrong. There was so much more. It’s hard to see clearly when the world is angry and divided and you’re being lied to.” Playlist 🎶Like A Rolling Stone- Bob Dylan 🎶Jockerman- Bob Dylan 🎶Fortunate Son- Creeedence Clearwater Revival 🎶Free Bird- Lynyrd Skynyrd 🎶Have You Ever Seen The Rain- Creedence Clearwater Revival 🎶Stand By Me- Ben E King 🎶Daniel- Elton John 🎶Oh, Pretty Woman- Roy Orbison 🎶Stairway To Heaven- Led Zeppelin 🎶American Pie- Don Mclean 🎶Unchained Melody- The Righteous Brothers 🎶Brown Eyed Girl- Van Morrison 🎶Bad Moon Rising- Creedence Clearwater Revival 🎶Simple Man- Lynyrd Skynyrd 🎶I Can See Clearly Now- Johnny Nash 🎶With A Little Help From My Friends- Joe Cocker 🎶Here Comes The Sun- The Beatles Thanks for Buddy Reading with me, I had a great time crying and screaming haha 😭💖",5.0,positive,The Women,127305853
