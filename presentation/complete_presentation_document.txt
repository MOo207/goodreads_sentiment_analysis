Objective: Analyze Goodreads book reviews and classify sentiment into three categories:
- Positive (4-5 stars)
- Neutral (3 stars)
- Negative (1-2 stars)

Dataset: 88 CSV files containing Goodreads reviews with star ratings

Approach: Compare traditional machine learning models with deep learning models

Outcome: Identify the best performing model for sentiment classification and provide
comprehensive analysis of the results

8. DATASET LABELING AND AUGMENTATION
====================================

DATASET LABELING
The dataset was labeled using the star ratings from Goodreads reviews:
- 1-2 stars: Negative sentiment (525 reviews)
- 3 stars: Neutral sentiment (215 reviews)
- 4-5 stars: Positive sentiment (1,552 reviews)

This approach provides a natural labeling mechanism based on user ratings.

DATASET AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUES

1. Language Filtering:
   - Non-English reviews were filtered out using langdetect library
   - Started with 2,438 reviews, ended with 2,292 English-only reviews
   - This improved data quality by ensuring linguistic consistency

2. Text Preprocessing:
   - Removal of punctuation and numbers
   - Tokenization using NLTK
   - Stopword removal using NLTK English stopwords
   - Stemming using Porter Stemmer

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Bag of Words representation with max 10,000 features
   - TF-IDF representation with max 10,000 features
   - Sequential representation for RNN models with max 10,000 words and 1,000 length

4. Data Balancing:
   - SMOTE + Tomek Links applied to handle class imbalance
   - This improved model performance on minority classes (negative and neutral)

9. ENHANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
==============================

To further improve model performance, consider the following enhancements:

1. ADVANCED TEXT PREPROCESSING:
   - Implement spell correction using pyspellchecker
   - Convert emojis to text representations

   - Expand TF-IDF features to 15K with n-grams up to 3-grams
   - Implement Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings to capture semantic relationships

3. ENSEMBLE METHODS:
   - Create soft voting ensembles combining NB, LR, and SVM models
   - Implement stacked ensembles with meta-learners (e.g., Logistic Regression)
   - Use boosting techniques like XGBoost or LightGBM

4. HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION:
   - Perform systematic hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
   - Use cross-validation for robust evaluation
   - Optimize learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures

5. ADVANCED MODELS:
   - Implement Bidirectional LSTM for better sequence modeling
   - Try CNN models for text classification with 1D convolutions
   - Experiment with hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures
   - Use transformer-based models like BERT for state-of-the-art performance
