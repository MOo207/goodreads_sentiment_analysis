METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTION
=====================

1. DATA PREPROCESSING
   - Language filtering: Only English reviews are retained
   - Text cleaning: Removal of punctuation, numbers, and special characters
   - Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words
   - Stopword removal: Common words that don't contribute to sentiment
   - Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms
   - Negation handling: Preserving sentiment context in negated phrases

2. SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION
   - Converting 5-star ratings to 3 sentiment categories:
     * 1-2 stars: Negative sentiment
     * 3 stars: Neutral sentiment
     * 4-5 stars: Positive sentiment

3. FEATURE EXTRACTION
   - Bag of Words (BOW): Traditional word count approach
   - TF-IDF: Term frequency-inverse document frequency for word importance
   - Sequential features: For deep learning models

4. MODEL TRAINING
   - Traditional ML models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM
   - Deep Learning models: LSTM and SimpleRNN for sequence modeling
   - Cross-validation: Ensuring robust model evaluation

5. MODEL EVALUATION
   - Accuracy metrics for comparing different approaches
   - Performance analysis explaining why some models work better
